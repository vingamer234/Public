1
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,299
Warning. Hostile ships detected.

2
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,266
Point of origin appears to be the same as
Captain Qwark's nav-beacon.

3
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:47,866
Hello. Let's get back to
saving Qwark and the fongoids

4
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,333
and take a moment out to—

5
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:55,400
Ratchet:
Qwark, I'm at the ship. Where are they holding you?

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,333
Qwark: I don't know. It's a big cell with some sort of containment field, [sniff]

7
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:02,633
ugh, that smells like my high school gym locker.

8
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,000
>> Alright, maintain radio silence.
I'll contact you when I'm inside.

9
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,199
>> I had to take a moment to address the fact that it's really warm in here.

10
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,900
And I also need caffeine.

11
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,866
I've actually had coffee for a while I just haven't been,

12
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,766
even drinking it.

13
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:29,333
Got a coffee warmer. So, we're good. But,

14
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:44,366
I don't want any tiredness to set in now. We haven't even got to Rayman yet.

15
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,733
Which will be in,

16
00:03:50,733 --> 00:03:52,400
an hour.

17
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,333
We are starting Rayman in an hour.

18
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,666
Less than an hour it look- hour. Round it up. Round it up.

19
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:15,199
Ship Computer:
Breach detected in starboard airlock.
Dispatching engineer.

20
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:29,166
Vorselon: Attention troopers. We have just
learned that the rebel Azimuth

21
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:33,966
has escaped our troops once again.
I have spoken with Dr. Nefarious and

22
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:40,666
he has agreed to raise the bounty
to 50,000 bolts. Dead or alive.

23
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:47,233
Enemy Trooper: I am an engineer, I fix stuff.

24
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:52,500
Nefarious doesn't want anyone else controlling the clock, he wants his‒

25
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,333
He wants him‒

26
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,766
it all to himself.
>> Trooper: Fred, is that you?

27
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:58,466
Trooper: Azimuth has escaped. You owe me five bolts.

28
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:29,233
Ship Computer:
Hyperspace fueling module, released.

29
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:36,033
Vorselon: Attention troopers: This is a reminder that no one is to execute the prisoners until we have extracted the

30
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,466
location of the rebel Azimuth.

31
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:42,800
Also, we will be serving fried weasel in the cafeteria.

32
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,699
>> Weasel?

33
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,800
...Cafeteria food is *not* very good.

34
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,033
Trooper: Ow, that hurts.

35
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,933
Sonic Eruptor detected.

36
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,100

Ship Computer:
Dispatching security team. 
>> The rebel is here. The rebel is here. Alert. Alert.

39
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,766
Fresh off the assembly line at GrummelNet HQ.

40
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:47,833
Welcome to the GrummelNet weapon shop.

41
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,933
Yep, you get a discount if you played Tools of Destruction.

42
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:54,300
Save file for it.

43
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Welcome back, chief.

44
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,066
You're full up, chief.

45
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:20,333
Trooper: The rebel is here. Alert. Alert.

46
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,666
Welcome back, chief.

47
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,633
Trooper: Destroy the rebel.

48
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,133
Got a holo-plan for the RYNO V.

49
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,533
Ratchet: 
Qwark, give me a status update.

50
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:43,799
Qwark: This guy Vorselon means business.
He says he'll kill us if we don't

51
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,666
give up Alister Azimuth.

52
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,899
>> Who is Alister Azimuth?

53
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:50,333
>> I don't know, some rebel.

54
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:57,133
>> Alright, well find out what you can. If he's an enemy of Nefarious, he might be a friend to us.

55
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:24,200
By the way, the pizza I had earlier was cauliflower crust pizza.

56
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,399
Tasty. A bit done though.

57
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:01,033
Wrong weapon.

58
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,500
Trying to level everything up to be three at the moment.

59
00:15:09,066 --> 00:15:20,666
Coffee. Coffee! I feel I feel... I feel my eyelids
getting somewhat heavy. So, not, not a good sign.

60
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:31,633
[Music]

61
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,033
That's something you you can't get rid of.

62
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,399
Oh yeah, there's supposed to be a teaser
trailer for the The Super Mario Bros. Movie.

63
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:29,766
[Music]

64
00:16:56,433 --> 00:17:02,766
I'm just so curious to see, what kind of uh.

65
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:08,666
How much uh the characters talk, I guess. You know.

66
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,733
What kind of style they go with. Is it going
to be like wacky, happy-go-lucky sort of,

67
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:26,099
Minions stuff. Or are they going to be somewhat like
Luigi's Mansion 3 and those those cutscenes.

68
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,366
Top level cutcenes. I'm I'm gonna play Luigi's Mansion 3,

69
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:36,400
I swear. I'm going to beat it this year for Halloween.

70
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:44,599
Probably not play the original Luigi's Mansion.

71
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,966
There goes the burp. Good.

72
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:53,333
I have nothing else to talk about. [laugh] Really.

73
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:24,833
I go in the right room...? No I'm not.
I know I'm not going the right direction.

74
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:34,000
The second or the third time I've died

75
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:19,433
Yeah I died to this guy previously, on the, uh -

76
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,400
Quantos

77
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,933
- That planet.

78
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:54,900
Live streams are really a different tone compared to let's plays.

79
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,733
Trying to think how would I even let's play this game and not

80
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,599
Have dead air.

81
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:04,433
I don't know, hah

82
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:09,400
I guess I did it with A Cra‒, Tools of Destruction, and uh

83
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:12,133
Quest for Booty, didn't I?

84
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,266
Guess I edited it out

85
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:19,633
Ship Computer:
Secondary hyperspace fueling module, released.

86

>> I always think the gameplay should be, uh

87
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,833
Shouldn't miss anything, with a let's play.

88
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:32,533
Ship Computer:
Um... Third-iary hyperspace fueling module, released.

89
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:36,733
>> It's 'tertiary' computer voice. Tertiary.

90
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,000
You need to upgrade your AI

91
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,066
It- It's, uh

92
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,766
Ship Computer:
Power failure detected in auxillary server room.

93
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,500
Power failure detected in auxillary server room.
>> You're... You're serving weasles

94
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:02,133
at your cafeteria, I don't know. It's a little weird.

95
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:02,799
Vorselon:
Attention troopers:

96
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,266
Vorselon:
Attention troopers:
>> Maybe weasles are really good if they're space weasles.

97
00:22:04,266 --> 00:22:06,466
Vorselon:
I don't want to point fingers,
>> Maybe weasles are really good if they're space weasles.

98
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:07,066
Vorselon:
But SOMEONE taped over last night's episode of Lance and Janice.

99
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:08,966
Vorselon:
But SOMEONE taped over last night's episode of Lance and Janice.
>> Get these

100
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:10,366
Vorselon:
But SOMEONE taped over last night's episode of Lance and Janice.

101
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,566
>> All turned around

102
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:16,133
Vorselon:
Will the trooper responsible please eject yourself out the airlock immediately.

103
00:22:16,133 --> 00:22:17,433
Vorselon:
Thank you.

104
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,366
>> The work environment sounds... lovely

105
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,966
Lovely.

106
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:41,200
I think the last time "Lance and Janice" was mentioned was Deadlocked, I believe -

107
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,400
Ship Computer:
What floor, please?

108
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,133
>> going back.
Ratchet: Um, 

109
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:46,599
Ratchet:
Detention wing?

110
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,466
Ratchet:
Wow. I can't believe that worked.

111
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:51,900
Ship Computer:
What was that?

112
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:52,833
Ratchet:
...Nothing!

113
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,766
Vorselon:
Insolent creature!

114
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:57,566
Give me the location of the rebel Azimuth!

115
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:59,900
Fongoid:
We don't know!!

116
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,400
That wasn't Azimuth, it was just a young lombax!

117
00:23:03,566 --> 00:23:06,166
Vorselon:
You are foolish to protect him.

118
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,466
Guards! Throw them in the brig.

119
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,933
If they haven't broken by the time we jump sectors,

120
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,933
eject them out the airlock!

121
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,433
Fongoid:
Someone! Help us!

122
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:19,099
>> Guy doesn't know who Azimuth is

123
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,566
Shake my head,

124
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:24,066
shake my head.

125
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,366
A lot older than that, pfft. C'mon.

126
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,133
Snoop around chief. You've got a right to

127
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:34,833
You have a vague idea of who he is maybe

128
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:39,966
Nefarious knows who he is, maybe he just, like...

129
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,133
Qwark:
We did it!

130
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,933
Everyone follow me! I'll get us outta here.

131
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:11,166
Ratchet: Stay quiet. We don't want to set off the alarm.

132
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,900
Ship Computer:
Alert! Alert!

133
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,766
There is a code red in the detention wing.

134
00:24:16,766 --> 00:24:20,200
Repeat - code red in the detention wing.

135
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,233
Mobilize all units.

136
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,633
Trooper: They must not leave the ship

137
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,099
Trooper: Alert Lord Vorselon.

138
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,333
Qwark:
Alright, let's go. Remember the buddy system.

139
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:05,833
Having Qwark actually do something in this game;

140
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,000
Not gonna lie, that's kind of, uh

141
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,700
Not gonna lie, that's kind of, uh
>> Qwark: The bridge is out— It's out!

142
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:10,299
Captain Qwark: What do we do?!

143
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,866
Captain Qwark: What do we do?!
>> meaningful.

144
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:21,133
Has he ever done anything to help Ratchet,

145
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,733
in gameplay, huh?

146
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,233
I mean, I guess hitting him when he's was a monkey -

147
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,733
kinda funny, but doesn't really do anything of value.

148
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:43,366
Comic relief

149
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,866
Explosive?

150
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:47,933
Blew it up

151
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,166
Nope, don't need anything.

152
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,599
Qwark:
We did it!

153
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,400
Everyone follow me! I'll get us outta here.

154
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,633
Ratchet: Stay quiet. We don't want to set off the alarm.

155
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:07,666
Ship Computer:
Alert! Alert!

156
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,700
There is a code red in the detention wing.
>> Trooper: They are escaping.

157
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,133
Repeat - code red in the detention wing.

158
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:16,166
Mobilize all units.

159
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,333
Qwark:
Alright, let's go. Remember the buddy system.

160
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,566
Taunting me

161
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:52,166
with bolts

162
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:58,066
Qwark: The bridge is out— It's out!

163
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,500
What do we do?!

164
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,433
>> Throw the little one across it. Heh.

165
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:10,133
Trooper: Hey! Get your own prisoners.

166
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:22,666
Qwark: Ahem, yes — well, well done! Ha,

167
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,433
Qwark: Ahem, yes — well, well done! Ha,
>> Oh no a big one again

168
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:26,799
Qwark: I almost had to hurl you all to safety myself.

169
00:27:26,866 --> 00:27:28,900
>> Here goes nothin'!

170
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:31,133
Am I gonna die?

171
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:37,833
...Stand behind Qwark?

172
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,466
I don't want to risk it.

173
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,366
This barrier

174
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,799
I'm tempting fate by saying that

175
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,066
Ugh!

176
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,299
You keep shooting at the ground - it might help...

177
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:00,799
You keep shooting at the ground - it might help...
>> Trooper: The fongoids are free.

178
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:03,599
Vorselon: They're heading for the escape vessel.

179
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,233
Shut down the auto launch module.

180
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:06,866
Stop- Mmm,

181
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:12,533
The quick select pause - I'm keeping it.
Regardless of how many times I die 

182
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,099
It's just less annoying, I think, as a viewer

183
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:24,866
This pistol is a no-thought weapon

184
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,966
This pistol is a no-thought weapon
>> Trooper: Lock down the detention wing.

185
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:33,000
Until you run out of ammo I guess

186
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:44,500
Mr. Zurkon: One little, two little dead little toasters.
Four little, five little dead little toasters.

187
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:47,233
>> Clank was a toaster...

188
00:28:47,233 --> 00:28:49,166
Clank was a toaster... [sad whimper]

189
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,333
He's not dead though. He's alive.

190
00:28:56,566 --> 00:28:58,099
'K

191
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:00,799
Is that it? Except for the,

192
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,500
Oh- it was nothing.

193
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:12,366
I, I don't know if you can even come back through here

194
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:15,266
I haven't seen any gold bolts yet, so

195
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,233
Nothing hidden

196
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:56,700
I love bolt cranks, it lets me.
Give a chance to look away from the game

197
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,000
>> Hello, bolt crank??

198
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,500
Clearly... I've never seen a bolt crank not work before.

199
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,833
>> Okay. I'm missing something.

200
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,733
Whew!

201
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:47,566
Qwark. What do I do here?

202
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:48,433
Qwark. What do I do here? Oh that.

203
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,733
Oh that's just for collectables.

204
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:52,666
Oh you release them first.

205
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,766
>> Systematic nonsense

206
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,533
Okay that opens the door

207
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:06,700
I guess that jettisons the cargo, uh the the

208
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:07,833
Excess car— and the,

209
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,133
Excess car— and the,
>> Qwark: The onboard computer says

210
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,033
Qwark:
there's a manual switch somewhere in that room -

211
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,433
Qwark:
Check the grav-ramp.

212
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,266
>> the escape pod.

213
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,900
Vorselon: Nooo!

214
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,233
Vorselon:
Computer, perform a bioscan across the entire ship.

215
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:47,900
Vorselon:
I want to know who helped those creatures escape!

216
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,033
Ship Computer:
Bioscan indicates one Lombax lifeform.

217
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:56,766
Vorselon: Azimuth! Welcome back.

218
00:31:56,766 --> 00:32:00,700
Vorselon:
I kept your old cell warm in the event you ever returned.

219
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,466
Vorselon: Computer, ready my best mech suit.
I'll handle this personally.

220
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,333
>> You're a little blobby guy just sitting there
at his console. In his fish tank, talkin' trash

221
00:32:19,933 --> 00:32:22,299
Out of the mech suit

222
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:29,633
Suit‒ it's gotta, it's gotta
conserve power to kill people, I guess

223
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:33,599
>> Aphelion, they've blocked my escape route. Meet me in the lower deck landing bay.

224
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,733
>> Affirmative. ETA: In 30 seconds.

225
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:46,299
Be with you shortly—

226
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,433
I'm gonna break some stuff

227
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:06,799
One bolt? C'mon.

228
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,099
Happy to meet you.

229
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,266
Here's a bomb.

230
00:33:33,966 --> 00:33:36,733
Guess this area opens up some more

231
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:37,966
So if we do come back

232
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:38,866
So if we do come back
>> Is your ar‒

233
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,799
Alright chief, what can we do you for?

234
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,599
Full.

235
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,366
>> —Arsenal antiquated? Your firepower fossilized?

236
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:46,566
—Arsenal antiquated? Your firepower fossilized?
>> Vendor.

237
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,466
Don't be embarrassed on the battlefield with last year's weapon.

238
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:53,066
In a very important location

239
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,966
Yep, this looks like a boss arena.

240
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,566
>> I guess his armor's pretty cool

241
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,099
Let's see how his boss fight fairs

242
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:27,500
Vorselon: Amateur! Did you really expect that

243
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,866
to work? You'd think we'd never done dance this before.

244
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:39,333
Vorselon: Is that it? Is that everything!?
>> Evidentally,

245
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:44,666
>> Azimuth actually meddled with Dr. Nefarious before

246
00:34:45,366 --> 00:34:48,099
'cause he doesn't know who Ratchet is.

247
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:53,800
Guess they're both after the Clock, but

248
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,366
I thought that plot only started in this game

249
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,333
time-wise

250
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:06,199
Vorselon: You are messing with Lord Vorselon!
Not even could Zordoom Prison could hold me!

251
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:23,500
Vorselon: Rgah! You're slower than last time, Azimuth.
You wouldn't be taking it easy on Lord Vorselon, would you?

252
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,800
I should have killed you back on Lumos!

253
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:37,699
>> Krell Canyon, innit

254
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,266
Vorselon: Now you don't!

255
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:43,199
>> Sneaky, sneaky

256
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,599
[where you gonna] Stop!

257
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:49,133
Vorselon: Lucky shot!

258
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:53,333
Vorselon: Ohh, how I've waited for this.

259
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:55,599
>> That's annoying

260
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,533
This fight gives you ammo though, right?

261
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:06,400
Vorselon: No, I will not allow it!
I will not be beaten by some worthless has-been!

262
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,933
>> I don't think you know who you're talking to,

263
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:12,266
this guy's saved two galaxies

264
00:36:12,266 --> 00:36:14,066
this guy's saved two galaxies
>> Vorselon: You're supposed to be the strongest of your kind.

265
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:15,366
Vorselon: You're supposed to be the strongest of your kind.
>> Three galaxies, including this one.

266
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:16,400
Vorselon: What happened?
>> Three galaxies, including this one.

267
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,066
Vorselon: Did you stop caring?

268
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:21,099
Or did your mind finally just snap?

269
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:23,033
Brah ha ha ha haha haa!

270
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,199
This cannot be happening!

271
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:28,866
Lord Vorselon will not fall to this terrible creature!

272
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,733
>> Now I need ammo

273
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:36,066
I like your death ray, it reminds me of Dr. Nefarious'

274
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:37,233
only less purple and less, awesome.

275
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:39,099
only less purple and less, awesome.
>> Vorselon: [sneakily]  Heh, heh, heh heh heh.

276
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,566
Don't like it as much.

277
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:46,433
It's very... Reminiscent. For that it gets some points.

278
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,099
Oh I almost got hit!

279
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:49,933
>> Lord Vorselon: How is this possible?!

280
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:54,800
>> "This can't be happening!"

281
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:19,300
Qwark:
Ratchet, great news. The Chief says Alister
Azimuth lives on Torren IV in the Vela Sector.

282
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,000
I'm uploading coordinates to your ship now.

283
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:27,533
In the meantime, I'll stay with the fongoids and find out what else they know about Azimuth. Qwark out.

284
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:37,266
>> I gotta get some ammo because I don't have to die at all

285
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,866
That's what I wanted to do, but,

286
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:08,800
No boxes?

287
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,699
Last time I was here,

288
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,000
Last time I was here, there were boxes.

289
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:23,666
Last time I played, there were boxes respawning
over and over. Ah. Ok. Alright, game.

290
00:38:26,366 --> 00:38:29,699
Maybe that was just a bug.

291
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,300
'K

292
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:42,366
Maybe, are we full up on ammo, eh. I'm far from it.

293
00:39:04,966 --> 00:39:08,699
Trooper: [over radio]
Sir, one of the prisoners has requested to speak with you.

294
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:11,133
He appears to be willing to cooperate.

295
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,633
Vorselon: Patch it through.

296
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,266
Qwark: Uhh, hey, Mr. Vorselon? Uh, my name's Captain Qwark, maybe you've heard of me?

297
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:22,333
"Saviour of Solana"? Number 97 in "Kerwan's 100 Most Eligible Bachelors", ha ha.

298
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:25,766
[breathes in] Anyway— uh, you seem like a reasonable...

299
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,766
floating, head in a tank, so,

300
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:31,400
I was wondering if we could settle this without violence?

301
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,233
Vorselon: Insolent creature!

302
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,966
Your request has fallen on deaf ears.

303
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:37,533
The only future you may hope for

304
00:39:37,533 --> 00:39:39,500
is a quick and merciful death,

305
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,533
following hours of unimaginable agony.

306
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,866
Qwark: Huh. So that's a "No", right?
