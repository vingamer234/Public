1
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:48,433
GoodYes yes.

2
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:58,966
I'm kind of stuck here aren't I I really
don't think there's anything I can do other
than restarting

3
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,666
Jeez Louise

4
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,133
Ridiculous

5
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:25,033
The butcher we need to find The ButcheryOver
that might be it.

6
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,933
That's why I'm going to call it

7
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,900
Here it is.

8
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,366
No sign on that so this just regular house
okay

9
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,733
Believe we need that to go in there
anyway.

10
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,733
I haven't been out here yet

11
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,166
They are faster than me almost

12
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,466
Even the big guy

13
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,333
Here it is

14
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,333
This should be it. Sack.

15
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,266
Back 'bout

16
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,599
Like a meat a meat house

17
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,500
You don't want to go in there quite yet. I might
get my ass handed to me

18
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,400
Okay now I'm ready

19
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,166
More danger upstairs.

20
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,533
Away from the barrels so I can

21
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,400
Perfect.

22
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,833
Okay I don't need... Can I get in

23
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,033
61. I haven't killed anyone yet

24
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,099
Doot doot doot doot dooooo

25
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,633
That was the blacksmith because the guy was
renowned for making busts, which of

26
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,466
one of which we have

27
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:26,466
But I don't think we would go there because
it's already it's already made so

28
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:33,866
Skip...

29
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,666
...The rope. They're like machines so they
don't add to the Chalice right. Do they?

30
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:45,333
Are they enchanted? They are, okay.

31
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,133
Made with, uh, magic. Dark magic from,

32
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:52,599
What's-his-face

33
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,833
Chaos Rune. I bet the Chaos Rune is outside the village.

34
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,333
Gonna wager a guess that's where it's at

35
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:28,299
I would think a hammer's good on these

36
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,966
Throwing daggers and crossbow.

37
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,433
It's not going to work well an armor.

38
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,066
Down here

39
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:18,900
Library

40
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,633
So interesting

41
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:22,599
And now I get hit.

42
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,766
Hit by the butcher. Great.

43
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,000
All of that: No no.

44
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,299
I do not want. *scoff*

45
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,033
Especially the dragon toads.

46
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:33,666
Oop. Back to the, church.

47
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:02,799
That's where the blacksmith comes in

48
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:12,166
I think I'll skip reading anything else I'll
come back later on my own time

49
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,366
Get these bones rolling

50
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:26,366
How do I get outside the village? That door's shut already?

51
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,400
I saw an exit

52
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:37,966
But we need something to make and we have the...

53
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,266
We already have stuff to make it with

54
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,666
A furnace thing.

55
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,299
Perhaps not

56
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,433
Using it

57
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:18,466
Need to do more

58
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,333
If I could just melt the statue I already have
I can get gold for the,

59
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,866
Crucifix.

60
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,166
Maybe I need to combine them? Like do them—

61
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:05,233
There's‒ this must be the gateway I need to go through

62
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,099
Oh, it's over here

63
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,266
Explore some more

64
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,200
"I see you!"

65
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:29,733
[continued accent]
Gonna lay ya out with one blow, I am!

66
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,666
'hop you right in half with my axe!

67
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:39,566
Wa‒ ter

68
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:41,333
Ah...

69
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,799
Something underwater.

70
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,900
Nothin- nothing here quite yet. I think,

71
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:02,933
Maybe the Shadow Rune will. Something here. I don't
know.

72
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,933
[with accent]
When I get mah hands on him

73
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:35,466
It's a roof tile or something on top of
that awning

74
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,366
OK, what do I do here?

75
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,366
That's a pretty color for the...

76
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,266
where...? Oh, it changes~

77
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,466
[chuckling] Holiday cookies

78
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,866
A way to open the gate

79
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,633
Oh was there something in there?
There was a, uh

80
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,800
That's stained glass, I thought there was a potion

81
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:15,466
Something else glowy

82
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:17,333
Is all

83
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:24,633
[exhaling]

84
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,966
Maybe I'm supposed to read

85
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:32,566
I didn't want to read.

86
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,933
That's the exit, I persume

87
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,566
head

88
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,533
Like Chernabog

89
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,666
Reading it is

90
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,199
The books do stay open

91
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,433
I'll put this in the right order when I edit this

92
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,833
I'm going backwards

93
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,300
Doesn't appreciate the finer arts of reading

94
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:14,566
And if you recall, I think all that was
probably spurred on by his dead puppy

95
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:17,533
Shame that.

96
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,966
As a child he got into alchemy, is... *hmpf*

97
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:23,766
Probably! I don't know.

98
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,400
Well that is obviously not it. There is no
lore-driven gameplay here.

99
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,500
Where do I go next

100
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,533
I am wondering I will try to figure it out
on my own though

101
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,533
Libraries done

102
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I keep on seeing "Trolls Head".

103
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,400
Don't know what that means. Like a tavern?

104
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:02,566
Door I haven't went through yet.

105
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,233
Is this, that's just the house. Yeah.

106
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,500
I can't go underwater that is a certainty

107
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:21,033
Nothing outside; that pond is not where we need to
go

108
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:24,966
Out of my way please. Thank you.

109
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,633
You're... Just fine

110
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:29,300
You-you're fine

111
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,033
I mean,

112
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,933
Not really, you're kind of possessed right
now, but

113
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,266
We'll‒ I'll take care of that. Sir Daniel Fortesque will.

114
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:39,199
We'll‒ I'll take care of that. Sir Daniel Fortesque will.

115
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:47,466
There... I think we just need to go to the.

116
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:48,866
There... I think we just need to go to the. Blacksmith.

117
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:51,633
Must be missing something.

118
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:57,800
As usual I am missing something

119
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,800
We just have a cast so we can't go to the

120
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,900
-That- area

121
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,500
Not going to do us any good

122
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,099
Need an actual, Crucifix

123
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:40,766
Maybe this really is like Bugs Bunny & Taz;
maybe I have to jump on this a lot more than I was.

124
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:56,800
The light changing in here, or is that just my
imagination

125
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:18,466
Boy speedrunning this level must be fun

126
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,033
I thought there would be some sort of
indication but

127
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,466
Indeed. Could be.

128
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,033
Ohh!

129
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,666
You have to do it in front

130
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,199
And melt the gold down

131
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:01,933
Again - in front of the forge.

132
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,300
To be fair it does prompt me what to do here

133
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:13,800
I just wasn't seeing it

134
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,300
Ta-daaaa!

135
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:42,800
Banish all evil

136
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,133
Except for the big, mech guys

137
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,400
Well, almost.

138
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,266
Well, almost. You'd think that would do something.

139
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,933
I guess that's cool

140
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,133
Heh heh heh heh‒

141
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:45,033
Are we going to do something... unsmart here

142
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:52,766
But like I know these Shadow Demons.
I think I've seen them before in gameplay

143
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:01,433
OK I'll be right back. Not going to leave this,

144
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:05,466
room, here, in case I end up getting...

145
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,533
Destroyed by something that appears now that we've done this

146
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,300
Heidi ho

147
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:01,633
Let's-a go

148
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:45,333
Ah, we looped around here

149
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,599
The other side of this gate now.

150
00:50:06,433 --> 00:50:07,966
Goods around here?

151
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,300
There's the Chalice

152
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:17,733
A potion.

153
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:21,466
do do

154
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:31,533
Gate from this side now

155
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,766
They do drop gold

156
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,166
One gold

157
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,500
I'll buy so much with that one piece of gold

158
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,033
Get in through the roof...

159
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,199
Ah! Probably.

160
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,033
[Looks] like a vault

161
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,566
We will unleash heck

162
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:43,633
upon the Earth.

163
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:47,699
Probably

164
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:56,966
Soon, soon - eventually we will. This is just the shadow...

165
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,066
have a key for

166
00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:02,099
"No safe is safe."

167
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,699
Especially this one

168
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:11,433
chateau artifact 

169
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,433
Chateau.

170
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,133
Is this a chateau, a shadow chateau? Cuz it's a
house?

171
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,133
Seems to have no other significance

172
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:35,099
Okay I got to go bash some.

173
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:38,866
Mechancial heads in and we can get the...

174
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:41,666
Chalice

175
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,900
Oh did the gate open?

176
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:49,666
How convenient. How convenient, thank you gate.

177
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,199
Must have been linked to the switch

178
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,366
100% per-cent. Percent

179
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,300
Avoid the dragon toads. Do not touch them.

180
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,900
We go right, for the witch

181
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:21,500
There's multiple paths to go down. I think we'll will go with the

182
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,333
There's multiple paths to go down. I think we'll will go with the, the ant tunnels first?

183
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,366
Ope‒ that's, that's not good!

184
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,766
That is one path we do *not* want to go down.

185
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:46,699
Wrong book. Wrong

186
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:47,566
Wrong book. Wrong thing.

187
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,266
I like the fairies are following us here,

188
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,566
ones we've rescued.

189
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:16,033
It's very easy to toggle off the HUD

190
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:21,066
It's mapped to the

191
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:22,300
L3 button.

192
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:40,800
Setting for the 30 FPS didn't persist, but pretty sure it's usually 30 FPS anyway on a regular PlayStation 4, so...

193
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:49,199
We're doing two things down here, one of which we just completed

194
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,366
Got enough amber for the witch.

195
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:06,066
I know what that means!

196
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,600
[And] me without a shield

197
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,399
Look at the pretty fairies

198
01:12:39,766 --> 01:12:43,566
I believe this level was pretty notorious back in the day

199
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,433
For being hard to get through.

200
01:12:47,066 --> 01:12:50,133
Looks much better in this version though

201
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,699
I feel like that's the case.

202
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:02,666
Solder ants here

203
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:06,199
Oh dear

204
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:29,066
Not too sure if I'm just bad at this game, or if it's really difficult

205
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,699
Little bit of column A, little bit of column B.

206
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:14,066
Bows here aren't really going to help us because they're so fast, these ants

207
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:18,333
They stay on us very easily

208
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:23,066
Feel like our strategy of just using a sword's probably for the best

209
01:14:35,366 --> 01:14:42,266
If I die again we'll go back and refill our health a little bit more if I can, if I can do that.

210
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:49,133
"Thank you for releasing me."
Oh really? You're doing that, doing the thank you for releasing me thing

211
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:54,566
You know what you're doing, fairy

212
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:59,166
You know what time your game came out in

213
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,899
Yeah it was a lot darker in the PS1 version.

214
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:35,833
Yeah it was a lot darker in the PS1 version.
That, I know of. 

215
01:15:36,433 --> 01:15:38,500
Open ze chest.

216
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:25,500
I've already been live long enough to be‒

217
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:28,533
This stream has been longer than the last one. 

218
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,033
This stream has been longer than the last one.
[Of] this game.

219
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:32,233
A lot of enemies here

220
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:54,233
Almost like the hit boxes on these ants
are too short to hit with the stronger attack

221
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:19,066
Did we just go in circles?

222
01:21:22,066 --> 01:21:24,800
Well that's easy to do in these

223
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,133
Labyrinth-like tunnels. Jeez.

224
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:35,533
That's one thing they kept true to the
original game. Confusing.

225
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,866
I had enough trouble in the village!

226
01:21:55,633 --> 01:21:59,233
I'm not going to bother with strong attacks

227
01:21:59,233 --> 01:22:01,199
I'm not going to bother with strong attacks.
They don't seem to connect.

228
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:59,066
Oh you have a jump attack as Dan, too

229
01:22:59,866 --> 01:23:03,000
You have some sort of jump attack, it's more of a stab.

230
01:23:04,566 --> 01:23:05,866
Be good to know

231
01:24:25,933 --> 01:24:30,133
Have a lot of sort of fossilized remains down here

232
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:34,433
Seen some ammonites

233
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:39,600
Trilobites... Amber of course

234
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,866
The hammer does deal more damage

235
01:25:13,966 --> 01:25:15,733
Two hits versus three

236
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:24,833
Unless the sword might be enchanted sometimes that would be, when you want to use it.

237
01:25:26,033 --> 01:25:28,399
I started off with it,

238
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:29,633
I started off with it, being a good idea

239
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,100
We're getting through this a little bit better now

240
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:37,033
The sword is faster, though

241
01:26:39,866 --> 01:26:43,766
You keep on using your hammer, you're going to be open to attacks more

242
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:55,500
These guys… Probably a good idea not to be open to attacks, they're very fast.

243
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:08,866
Like I've found a way forward without too much
trouble

244
01:27:21,566 --> 01:27:24,833
Ah, we're being overachievers now are we?

245
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,000
This is very pretty

246
01:27:40,933 --> 01:27:42,899
I don't like, what

247
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,766
I don't like that though, that looks ominous

248
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:54,566
I could tell when there's a boss up ahead

249
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:12,266
The telltale signs of something dangerous

250
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,733
How wonderful.

251
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:36,833
ooh

252
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:39,433
[repelled]
ooh.

253
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:49,433
Hmm, yeah there's there's an ant somewhere here.

254
01:30:18,233 --> 01:30:22,433
And I don't have a shield. This is not going to be…

255
01:30:23,433 --> 01:30:26,100
Clean. This is not going to be clean, I bet.

256
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:31,399
At least I have an enchanted sword now

257
01:30:34,966 --> 01:30:39,133
Got a weak point, or a charge up attack? Okay.

258
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,333
OK I probably want a ranged weapon -this- time around

259
01:31:08,466 --> 01:31:12,966
Actually it's both: A weak spot and it's charging its a charge up

260
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,366
Why don't you crush the ants

261
01:32:59,566 --> 01:33:01,500
Yeah!!

262
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,633
"Antagonist"! [chuckle]

263
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:13,300
That went better than expected I almost died. I came, I came within the

264
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,066
That went better than expected I almost died. I came, I came within the range of dying, but uh

265
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:20,433
Let's deal with this guy rather.

266
01:33:20,933 --> 01:33:21,966
Jesus

267
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:31,000
so's the aforementioned dying

268
01:33:32,466 --> 01:33:38,100
Fortunately they give us some health, or is, is that that a teleport

269
01:33:41,933 --> 01:33:43,566
I think that's an exit

270
01:33:47,633 --> 01:33:51,199
Am I stuck down here though, I feel like I missed a...

271
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,566
I am stuck down here.

272
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,733
A victorious retreat

273
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,199
You fairies can be saved next time.

274
01:34:47,033 --> 01:34:48,366
Now that's going to be helpful

275
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,866
we'll find out what it is

276
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,399
once we go to a new level.

277
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,800
I think we'll just go ahead and go

278
01:34:56,033 --> 01:35:00,433
 let's explore the enchanted grounds a little bit more

279
01:35:02,666 --> 01:35:04,766
If I can get to it

280
01:35:06,433 --> 01:35:07,800
There we go.

281
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,833
The enchanted grounds, The Enchanted Earth. Soil.

282
01:35:19,966 --> 01:35:21,266
"Detritus"?

283
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:23,500
detritus

284
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:27,866
Is that a word, detritus?

285
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:29,366
I don't know how to say that

286
01:35:34,966 --> 01:35:38,866
That's too big of a word for me to actually pronounce correctly.

287
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:40,366
That's too big of a word for me to actually pronounce correctly. Too smart.

288
01:35:42,766 --> 01:35:44,600
I shall retreat.

289
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,300
What are you doing…


290
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,066
What are you doing…
Dan is that a chicken?

291
01:35:50,899 --> 01:35:53,500
Pull out a chicken

292
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,733
Pulled out an emergency chicken.  For some reason.

293
01:36:08,033 --> 01:36:09,333
If I if I if I,

294
01:36:09,433 --> 01:36:15,266
Take myself out will I get health back or
will I just respawn almost dead again

295
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,399
Let's find out!

296
01:36:18,566 --> 01:36:20,566
"Shadow Demons"…

297
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:24,066
Is this linked to the, we need the shadow

298
01:36:24,066 --> 01:36:30,966
yeah that's the, the Shadow Artifact will let us get the Shadow Demons opened.

299
01:36:31,866 --> 01:36:34,633
The Tomb of the Shadows, if you will

300
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,933
"Tomb of the Ancients", yeah.

301
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:46,699
Nice, Rayman...

302
01:36:50,766 --> 01:36:55,633
*I* didn't set the chicken drumstick to anything, it just appeared

303
01:36:59,966 --> 01:37:01,566
Embrace the toads

304
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:12,699
Emergency life bottle

305
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,233
The very least I'll get a full health bar.

306
01:37:20,633 --> 01:37:22,633
Wouldn't leave me with nothing would you

307
01:38:12,233 --> 01:38:14,233
It left me with nothing.

308
01:38:14,899 --> 01:38:16,766
This is the, uh

309
01:38:18,933 --> 01:38:21,866
This is "Dark Souls" before Dark Souls was a
thing

310
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:37,633
Where is an easy to get to fountain

311
01:38:44,066 --> 01:38:48,600
I suppose Cemetery... Return to the Graveyard?

312
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,100
Actually I just think, uh

313
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:02,033
The Graveyard would be it

314
01:39:11,033 --> 01:39:14,733
Actually multiple ones there, being the first level and all

315
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:25,566
So what did I do over my month break of streaming - from streaming?

316
01:39:27,266 --> 01:39:30,500
I played some more Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled

317
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,533
Get some pit stop progress, didn't...

318
01:39:36,766 --> 01:39:40,199
unlocked a few things, one new character

319
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:44,066
Nothing too exciting though

320
01:39:47,966 --> 01:39:57,066
I got a, a single Velo time trial, in Coco
Park - one of the easiest tracks in the game.

321
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,600
First Velo time trial ghost I beat.

322
01:40:00,766 --> 01:40:07,433
OK, so there should be easy to get fountain and also easy to avoid enemies right

323
01:40:09,533 --> 01:40:11,833
Won't be dying anytime soon here

324
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,066
Can't catch me some zombs.

325
01:40:15,066 --> 01:40:16,333
Can't catch me some zombs. Zombles

326
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,366
There, money

327
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:21,833
I will take that again.

328
01:40:37,733 --> 01:40:41,833
Why do I have a chicken drumstick again? What is with the chicken?

329
01:40:47,566 --> 01:40:50,000
Oh you do have a charge shot, cool

330
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:59,133
There's one more fountain in this area

331
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,899
I believe

332
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:06,433
Unless the graveyard does get split up and I'm thinking of that level

333
01:41:17,366 --> 01:41:18,633
Rune

334
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,133
Here we are

335
01:44:53,733 --> 01:44:55,699
Hello I am back

336
01:45:02,066 --> 01:45:03,399
Where we going next

337
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:12,699
We're gonna explore more of The Enchanted Earth

338
01:45:13,366 --> 01:45:15,066
Without being

339
01:45:20,033 --> 01:45:21,866
Susceptible to death

340
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:36,300
That's noooo good

341
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:41,100
Chat I don't find myself...

342
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:45,566
Chat I don't find myself very commonly in this situation,

343
01:45:45,566 --> 01:45:50,633
but what do you do when there's a cat that wants your attention and you're trying to play a game?

344
01:45:51,699 --> 01:45:53,133
Do you ignore the cat?

345
01:45:54,233 --> 01:45:56,566
So I see the captions aren't working

346
01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:59,933
But I am talking, and it's coming through,


347
01:45:59,933 --> 01:46:02,333
But I am talking, and it's coming through,
Sooo, let's reset that

348
01:46:04,933 --> 01:46:07,933
Let's reset that and it get working

349
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:21,333
Should be better okay that's better

350
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,466
So those ants that we killed in the tunnels down there

351
01:46:30,266 --> 01:46:34,899
They didn't count towards the Chalice, so that's technically a separate level entirely

352
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:40,300
But we definitely have stuff to do here because we have a Shadow

353
01:46:42,733 --> 01:46:43,566
...Artifact

354
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
What did the witch give us? Let's find out

355
01:46:52,733 --> 01:46:54,399
What did we get from the witch?

356
01:46:54,933 --> 01:46:56,533
We get anything good?

357
01:46:56,733 --> 01:46:59,466
Did... She give me a chicken drumstick? Is that why I had that equipped?

358
01:47:03,699 --> 01:47:05,000
That is hilarious.

359
01:47:11,433 --> 01:47:13,233
Why.

360
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:16,166
It's so useless

361
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:18,566
What am I supposed to do with that

362
01:47:26,166 --> 01:47:27,100
Ok

363
01:47:57,366 --> 01:48:01,300
What's more economical the crossbow or the longbow

364
01:48:17,466 --> 01:48:20,966
'Course we can get the witch summoned again if we want

365
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,600
If we want to go down there but I don't want to do that anymore.

366
01:48:27,266 --> 01:48:29,066
Too claustrophobic down there

367
01:48:34,233 --> 01:48:36,866
I don't I think I'd rather go with the bow here

368
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,000
The game seems to do that a lot

369
01:48:43,133 --> 01:48:47,633
Get something new, the old weapon just kind of becomes,

370
01:48:47,633 --> 01:48:50,433
Get something new the old weapon just kind of becomes pointless to use.

371
01:48:52,866 --> 01:48:56,600
Oh if you run out of ammo then there'd be a good reason to go—

372
01:48:56,766 --> 01:48:58,600
None shall pass!

373
01:49:02,899 --> 01:49:05,533
Ah that's probably the

374
01:49:08,566 --> 01:49:11,100
Probably related to the artifact huh -

375
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:20,933
guardians keeping us out.

376
01:49:21,699 --> 01:49:23,699
Where does this go?


377
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:25,066
Where does this go?
Nowhere.

378
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:51,699
A golden dragon egg

379
01:50:04,166 --> 01:50:07,766
That's where we got the Witch's

380
01:50:07,766 --> 01:50:09,633
That's where we got the Witch's Talisman,

381
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,033
Cemetery Hill.

382
01:50:31,366 --> 01:50:33,866
A small detail I thought I heard there

383
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:41,566
Must have been Sir Dan's armor

384
01:50:45,566 --> 01:50:47,066
Clanking around

385
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:51,166
Going in here yet? Course not.

386
01:50:51,366 --> 01:50:54,899
Guess we do need to go up to the treetops

387
01:51:28,233 --> 01:51:32,833
And I'll go ahead and tell you right now the the
goblet-

388
01:51:33,033 --> 01:51:35,566
What's this thing called? The goblet

389
01:51:36,066 --> 01:51:39,300
What what... the uh, the uh

390
01:51:43,466 --> 01:51:48,300
The drinky thingy, you want to kill the Shadow Demons to fill it this time

391
01:51:48,433 --> 01:51:51,033
everything else doesn't do any good

392
01:51:54,866 --> 01:51:57,100
Our health is full.


393
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,166
Our health is full. Nearly.


394
01:51:59,166 --> 01:52:01,100
Our health is full. Nearly.
Might as well be.

395
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,000
Oh did I find some treasure

396
01:52:35,566 --> 01:52:37,899
Oh that's very hidden

397
01:52:40,233 --> 01:52:41,100
Go on the other side

398
01:52:42,466 --> 01:52:44,600
Hey kind of

399
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:48,133
Not really

400
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:57,466
I feel like I'm quiet again in terms of comparing it to the game's

401
01:52:57,633 --> 01:52:58,899
Turn it down a bit

402
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:03,000
I've been keeping an eye on it

403
01:53:43,633 --> 01:53:46,666
How quickly am I going to get attacked by things

404
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,699
These are dragon eggs and they're going to be dragons, right

405
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:14,066
What a cool level

406
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:27,166
A nest. What was noise?

407
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,500
Talons

408
01:54:48,199 --> 01:54:50,533
Look at the book entry, here

409
01:54:57,033 --> 01:54:58,833
Get a trophy for all this stuff

410
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:00,300
Get a trophy for all this stuff. Probably.

411
01:55:03,699 --> 01:55:04,899
Dragon Bird

412
01:55:05,333 --> 01:55:06,433
The boyd

413
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,733
"She's not just a set of legs - there's" … Play the narration

414
01:55:45,933 --> 01:55:48,633
Hold on a second. This text is kind of small

415
01:55:48,899 --> 01:55:55,166
So I'm going to go back and actually enable the game subtitles for the stream

416
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:57,966
[Didn't] realize it was so small

417
01:56:02,133 --> 01:56:05,033
Let me help you out there with that

418
01:56:29,899 --> 01:56:31,033
[laughs]

419
01:56:35,733 --> 01:56:38,233
Be gone, beast!

420
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:42,366
Dis-gus-tang!, Disgusting beast, get out of here

421
01:56:43,933 --> 01:56:46,633
She is gone, actually, she is dead.


422
01:56:46,633 --> 01:56:49,466
She is gone, actually, she is dead.
We took care of the Queen Ant

423
01:57:06,633 --> 01:57:11,966
I have some questions though. How does the narrator know what an airlock is

424
01:57:12,866 --> 01:57:15,633
Isn't this supposed to be the Medieval times?

425
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:20,733
What else could it be other than a space

426
01:57:21,066 --> 01:57:22,533
A spacecraft

427
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,666
Where am?

428
01:57:54,199 --> 01:58:00,100
Okay probably not the best idea for a sword to be used here

429
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:04,566
Do I get a target if I switch to my bow

430
01:58:09,933 --> 01:58:15,066
I mean it's listed as a boss in the Book of Gallowmere, so I assume we do defeat it

431
01:58:19,466 --> 01:58:22,633
Even though the eggs are what we're coming up here for all right

432
01:58:37,133 --> 01:58:38,666
Oh there we go

433
01:58:40,033 --> 01:58:43,000
Gold for that.

434
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,500
Gold for that. Oh she's gonna be maaad.

435
01:58:55,966 --> 01:58:58,633
Okay I guess no defeating you

436
01:58:58,899 --> 01:59:00,966
Mama bird.

437
01:59:01,766 --> 01:59:03,199
I just leave you,

438
01:59:05,066 --> 01:59:09,199
I'm sure, I'm sure you'll have more babies at some point

439
01:59:12,533 --> 01:59:17,699
Distressed. I'll leave her distressed, and unhappy with me.

440
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:26,266
I thought there would be more to it, but I guess that's it.

441
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,766
I mean I did get money from that, can't argue with that

442
01:59:46,466 --> 01:59:47,366
Shield

443
01:59:47,733 --> 01:59:52,566
This has like Zelda energy, it's like I get a shield but it's useless. what.

444
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:57,033
Literally I already had a shield so

445
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,100
No point in collecting it. I guess I could come back and get it.

446
02:00:02,833 --> 02:00:05,533
Again that's going back to what I said before

447
02:00:05,533 --> 02:00:12,133
it can pay off to know where all the collectibles and the healing spots are in the game

448
02:00:13,333 --> 02:00:18,066
You can go back and prep yourself I guess; they do come back.

449
02:00:19,766 --> 02:00:24,500
Wrong door. It's not the right door.

450
02:00:26,766 --> 02:00:28,366
What am I shooting at

451
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:50,066
Why's there a gargoyle behind a gate

452
02:00:51,899 --> 02:00:53,266
What is the point of that

453
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,899
Shadows

454
02:01:42,866 --> 02:01:45,000
...Why do I want to do this again?

455
02:01:52,933 --> 02:01:55,066
Leave now or share their doom. Okay!

456
02:01:55,633 --> 02:01:57,899
I'll leave. Heheh

457
02:01:59,433 --> 02:02:00,566
I'll leave.

458
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:05,800
I knew I'd drown there, I knew that was a deep pool of water

459
02:02:06,066 --> 02:02:07,533
Not safe not safe.

460
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:11,600
[exhausted sigh]

461
02:02:17,666 --> 02:02:19,366
Yep, I'm leavin'

462
02:02:21,533 --> 02:02:23,633
Gonna go away from that.

463
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:34,300
Clearly there's something that goes here

464
02:02:35,566 --> 02:02:37,533
To stop these lasers.

465
02:02:51,899 --> 02:02:55,800
You know it wouldn't be the first time I've taken a game too literally

466
02:02:56,766 --> 02:03:01,433
The first time I played Zelda: Breath of the Wild I didn't talk to Impa

467
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,600
The entire game, until

468
02:03:03,733 --> 02:03:11,500
I decided, okay I probably missed something I was like oh I am ready I guess I guess you were just...

469
02:03:15,633 --> 02:03:20,600
I took them too seriously and I was like "Okay. I'm probably not ready."

470
02:03:21,066 --> 02:03:23,000
"This might not be a good thing"

471
02:03:25,633 --> 02:03:27,500
That's one way you can play the game,

472
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,533
Just explore it and not focus on the story stuff.

473
02:03:36,466 --> 02:03:41,866
All it was was the memories; you unlock the ability to regain Link's memories.

474
02:03:43,866 --> 02:03:48,899
I think Impa put that a little bit too high up on this seriousness level if you ask me

475
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,500
I'm only going to go somewhere else because I have somewhere else to go

476
02:04:07,233 --> 02:04:13,366
If I need to come, if I need to go back there - fine, I will. But let's just go to the hedge maze here

477
02:04:14,666 --> 02:04:22,000
Asylum Grounds. This is a pretty fun level I think. From what I could, from what I've seen.

478
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:26,466
At least, it looks cool. I don't know if it's irritating.

479
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:58,600
Why does that keep happening

480
02:05:02,433 --> 02:05:03,366
Darn gates!

481
02:05:04,166 --> 02:05:06,466
These hinges are too...

482
02:05:06,566 --> 02:05:08,966
These hinges are too... Well,

483
02:05:08,966 --> 02:05:10,000
These hinges are too... Well-maintained.

484
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,100
These hinges are too... Well-maintained. They just
close on their own.

485
02:05:38,433 --> 02:05:39,399
Oh dear

486
02:06:04,866 --> 02:06:05,666
[slight panic]

487
02:06:21,899 --> 02:06:25,033
Case in point - my shield is already gone

488
02:06:28,966 --> 02:06:32,433
Y'know, if it weren't everything in this game being so...

489
02:06:32,833 --> 02:06:34,433
Oh, you want to kill me.

490
02:06:35,433 --> 02:06:38,033
Exactly. It's kind of cute looking isn't it? 

491
02:06:40,666 --> 02:06:43,399
It is the cutest thing I've seen in this game.

492
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,199
In a strange sort of way

493
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,300
Are you Jack?

494
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,899
Are you Jack? Big statue guy

495
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:37,566
Riddles are not my strong suit

496
02:08:06,533 --> 02:08:08,699
And more friendlies here to listen

497
02:08:09,233 --> 02:08:10,066
About

498
02:08:11,666 --> 02:08:13,000
That's not uh

499
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:16,966
Rats, they are the rats.

500
02:09:30,366 --> 02:09:32,233
Heh heh heh heh…

501
02:09:34,033 --> 02:09:35,800
The Rat King.

502
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,366
The Rat King. Where have I heard that before?

503
02:10:03,333 --> 02:10:04,466
Mmm, brisket

504
02:10:50,566 --> 02:10:54,033
You actually get— no, that's the, the Shadow Beasts

505
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,899
Seems like part of a puzzle to me

506
02:14:03,766 --> 02:14:05,433
Not the one we're doing now though

507
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:35,666
Oh. Yeah, ok...

508
02:14:43,399 --> 02:14:44,899
X marks the spot huh

509
02:14:49,766 --> 02:14:53,300
Okay that's definitely a wall I can break down right

510
02:14:54,199 --> 02:14:56,733
Surely that one will be broken

511
02:15:00,733 --> 02:15:01,533
Oh, no

512
02:15:14,766 --> 02:15:15,833
Get back here!

513
02:15:21,433 --> 02:15:23,100
I need you for my Chalice

514
02:15:47,899 --> 02:15:49,600
Stars?

515
02:15:50,233 --> 02:15:52,933
Stars are something that don't show up during the day.

516
02:16:03,533 --> 02:16:05,199
I need to hear that one more time

517
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:20,966
Stars -would- match that description

518
02:16:24,833 --> 02:16:26,266
But who steals stars?

519
02:16:30,199 --> 02:16:31,433
Why would you say that

520
02:16:46,466 --> 02:16:50,266
Like what else would the topriaries be for right?

521
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:52,799
Topriary

522
02:16:54,066 --> 02:16:57,000
There we go

523
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:03,299
Doing the thing with the captioner again. 
Bad at pronouncing things.

524
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,833
I'll solve this like I solve any other puzzle! 


525
02:17:11,833 --> 02:17:15,533
I'll solve this like I solve any other puzzle! 
Wandering around until I figure it out.

526
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:21,299
Stars are it.

527
02:17:22,299 --> 02:17:24,600
Yep. That's it.

528
02:17:25,733 --> 02:17:27,466
He want me to…

529
02:17:28,566 --> 02:17:31,466
Slash up all the star topiaries

530
02:17:36,333 --> 02:17:39,299
Chaos Rune needed

531
02:17:39,299 --> 02:17:41,000
Chaos Rune needed. This gate.

532
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:54,299
Are there two sides to this place

533
02:17:57,333 --> 02:17:58,700
Oh here's one.

534
02:18:24,666 --> 02:18:27,200
Nope. They gotta be over here.

535
02:18:28,466 --> 02:18:30,600
What is that out there, a mansion?

536
02:18:36,366 --> 02:18:38,700
Hm. We'll find out some day.

537
02:18:43,299 --> 02:18:44,233
Is that a squid?

538
02:18:44,933 --> 02:18:45,933
What the heck

539
02:18:51,633 --> 02:18:53,133
What the

540
02:18:53,533 --> 02:18:55,500
Cthulhu is that

541
02:19:18,266 --> 02:19:21,233
I'm beginning to wonder if some of these walls aren't breakable

542
02:19:26,133 --> 02:19:29,799
Shall just try breaking all the walls

543
02:19:30,399 --> 02:19:34,066
Oh there's a face‒ there's faces, in this walls.

544
02:19:34,299 --> 02:19:37,866
These are the hedges of evil.

545
02:19:37,866 --> 02:19:39,233
These are the hedges of evil. Truly.

546
02:19:56,799 --> 02:19:57,933
Fish.

547
02:20:23,266 --> 02:20:26,299
Cross.

548
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:27,799
X-mark.

549
02:21:56,266 --> 02:21:58,100
Is that a freaking camel

550
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:02,766
This place is weird man

551
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:56,033
ope. new way

552
02:23:37,133 --> 02:23:38,200
'k…

553
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,533
Hmm

554
02:25:49,433 --> 02:25:51,399
Need a faster weapon

555
02:25:54,299 --> 02:25:56,133
a *faster* weapon

556
02:26:43,233 --> 02:26:44,333
Almost have it

557
02:27:03,766 --> 02:27:05,233
It doesn't appear to be timed

558
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:07,500
It's just a matter of being faster

559
02:27:08,066 --> 02:27:11,899
Or, it *does* appear to be timed. There's no, uh

560
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,033
Puzzle here

561
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:25,500
Yeah, ah.

562
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:26,500
Yeah, ah. Hmm.

563
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:28,666
Yeah, ah. Hmm. Interesting

564
02:27:43,899 --> 02:27:45,666
Getting so close

565
02:28:17,799 --> 02:28:18,966
Let it reset here

566
02:28:20,533 --> 02:28:27,899
I'm feeling like there's something up here, because I don't have a way to refill my ammo that easily

567
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,266
I can hit them all at the same time, that would be one way of doing it

568
02:30:25,066 --> 02:30:26,166
Hm...

569
02:30:26,166 --> 02:30:28,366
I think the crossbow is the way to go

570
02:31:50,566 --> 02:31:52,500
I can't see anything

571
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,166
I can't see Jack

572
02:31:59,566 --> 02:32:01,766
Behind the wall, like that.

573
02:32:01,966 --> 02:32:03,433
But I will go see Jack.

574
02:32:06,666 --> 02:32:09,366
In case I need to do that first

575
02:32:12,766 --> 02:32:13,466
Yes yes.

576
02:32:21,366 --> 02:32:23,333
Get our equipment back up

577
02:32:26,633 --> 02:32:32,833
nah I think we're good with the sword for those guys

578
02:32:32,833 --> 02:32:33,566
nah I think we're good with the sword for those guys, so

579
02:36:00,266 --> 02:36:03,466
I think I'm missing something I need here to complete the level

580
02:36:05,266 --> 02:36:09,533
So we'll just, we'll do this... We'll do this some other time

581
02:36:26,933 --> 02:36:28,633
Time to unleash hell

582
02:36:29,366 --> 02:36:31,299
Yep let's do that

583
02:36:35,566 --> 02:36:37,133
Back to the shadows

584
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:41,366
Uhn-uh uh, that's not the thing you do there

585
02:39:45,733 --> 02:39:49,066
I was thinking I could because there was a,

586
02:39:49,066 --> 02:39:51,566
I was thinking I could because there was, a secret area with

587
02:39:51,933 --> 02:39:54,866
Some money but, I was a little off

588
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,299
Wrong door. Again.

589
02:40:35,799 --> 02:40:36,899
There we go

590
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,733
Are we at another dead end

591
02:42:57,133 --> 02:42:59,633
These symbols me nothing to me

592
02:43:21,333 --> 02:43:27,299
I don't know if restarting. And quitting, do the same thing for our health or whatever.

593
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:59,266
Ain't no way there's a way to continue right now

594
02:43:59,666 --> 02:44:03,233
I guess we'll go back to the hedge

595
02:44:03,233 --> 02:44:04,666
I guess we'll go back to the hedge, the hedges

596
02:44:13,633 --> 02:44:15,399
Did all that stuff

597
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:28,299
Oh that's the building we're seeing. The Asylum. That's the Asylum.

598
02:48:46,233 --> 02:48:48,066
That's easy, that's an elephant

599
02:48:54,433 --> 02:48:55,700
Kitties

600
02:52:01,033 --> 02:52:03,666
Yeah, that's right; -eat- my arrows!

601
02:52:07,899 --> 02:52:09,600
Weird bird octopus thing.

602
02:52:12,233 --> 02:52:12,933
Bat.

603
02:52:16,033 --> 02:52:18,366
And it kind of like a

604
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:20,899
it's like a... it's like a

605
02:52:20,899 --> 02:52:23,133
it's like a... it's like a, cursed

606
02:52:23,466 --> 02:52:25,433
Cthulhu Furby  

607
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:26,799
[absurd laughter]

608
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:29,666
Weird Furby monster

609
02:52:32,833 --> 02:52:36,000
Anything else in this area that I missed

610
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:41,433
Definitely not. Too small, not much not much to do there

611
02:52:42,033 --> 02:52:44,266
I got the rune, let's head back

612
02:52:49,266 --> 02:52:50,233
Doo

613
02:53:10,799 --> 02:53:14,700
It is going to be a bit of a challenge with all these cats

614
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:16,799
Do I need to kill the cats?

615
02:53:20,233 --> 02:53:22,000
Can I kill the cats?

616
02:53:23,933 --> 02:53:25,299
I just avoid them

617
02:53:27,399 --> 02:53:28,133
Oh dear

618
02:53:30,166 --> 02:53:30,899
[laughs]

619
02:53:45,066 --> 02:53:47,166
Keep this camera angle here

620
02:55:14,533 --> 02:55:18,000
Yes that hides the blood too

621
02:55:19,066 --> 02:55:23,000
What what do they call that game mechanic, in like Call of Duty 

622
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:28,166
So many games use that

623
02:55:52,466 --> 02:55:54,200
Nope no new path yet

624
02:56:04,366 --> 02:56:07,633
Ooh I need that. Very badly.

625
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:11,000
How do I get there

626
02:56:42,266 --> 02:56:43,933
Through the elephant

627
02:56:43,933 --> 02:56:45,399
probably

628
02:56:55,766 --> 02:56:59,533
I am gonna actually stick to ranged attacks here

629
02:57:01,933 --> 02:57:03,133
I'm ready! Come get me.

630
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:06,766
Cowards

631
02:57:28,066 --> 02:57:29,266
Oh my dear

632
02:57:38,266 --> 02:57:42,566
Does that mean every one of them's defeated or is there still one alive back there

633
02:57:47,666 --> 02:57:50,733
There's still a little bit of error

634
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:52,966
Room for error here.

635
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:11,733
You don't want to touch that chest.


636
02:58:11,733 --> 02:58:15,033
You don't want to touch that chest.
Do not touch that chest.

637
02:58:15,033 --> 02:58:17,399
You don't want to touch that chest.
Do not touch that chest. You will be dead.

638
02:58:19,066 --> 02:58:21,266
Uh, wrong item

639
02:58:32,366 --> 02:58:33,566
[fearful gasp]

640
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:41,966
I hit the explosive chest.

641
02:58:44,566 --> 02:58:45,933
[sigh of relief]

642
02:58:46,899 --> 02:58:50,033
Came within inches of my life being gone

643
02:58:52,033 --> 02:58:53,866
ohhhh, we survived

644
02:58:53,866 --> 02:58:55,166
ohhh, we survived :)

645
02:58:56,433 --> 02:58:59,500
That is without a doubt the closest I've got

646
02:58:59,633 --> 02:59:03,533
Closest I've got to dying for the longest amount of time. that was…

647
02:59:05,799 --> 02:59:07,633
That was, uhh

648
02:59:13,166 --> 02:59:16,600
Scary. that was scary. Mhm hmm.

649
02:59:17,366 --> 02:59:18,799
Okay…

650
02:59:19,766 --> 02:59:20,666
[mouth click]

651
02:59:32,933 --> 02:59:34,966
What's this then?

652
02:59:35,266 --> 02:59:36,666
All this then?

653
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:41,200
Clearly a puzzle.

654
02:59:43,433 --> 02:59:47,233
Of which I have no arrows. I need to find a gargoyle.

655
03:00:16,799 --> 03:00:18,366
Or not.

656
03:00:20,233 --> 03:00:22,299
This is very unfair.

657
03:00:26,299 --> 03:00:29,033
Listen, game… If there's one thing you can learn from Zelda,

658
03:00:29,033 --> 03:00:34,100
it's to give me refills in my items that I actually need to complete the dungeon

659
03:00:34,933 --> 03:00:37,433
I have no arrows.

660
03:00:37,666 --> 03:00:40,866
For I was fearing for my life back there.

661
03:00:44,133 --> 03:00:48,066
Maybe I don't use arrows. Maybe maybe there's
something else here.

662
03:00:49,533 --> 03:00:53,833
Okay I could just jump over the fence that's there for, some reason

663
03:00:53,833 --> 03:00:56,966
it's to block the blocks from getting out of the area.

664
03:00:57,933 --> 03:00:58,833
Clearly

665
03:01:08,033 --> 03:01:14,133
I was thinking we'd find a fire arrow puzzle

666
03:01:15,933 --> 03:01:17,700
Maybe at some point. Not here though.

667
03:01:26,133 --> 03:01:29,066
It is a good thing to keep in mind for any enemies

668
03:01:33,233 --> 03:01:36,466
We might want to catch on fire, hehehe

669
03:04:41,933 --> 03:04:45,600
I‒ I guess I was supposed to do that - oh, chess

670
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:47,766
Oi !

671
03:06:22,333 --> 03:06:24,566
Ok,

672
03:06:24,566 --> 03:06:27,366
We have time for one more level.

673
03:07:59,366 --> 03:08:02,333
Okay so now we can enchant a shield as well

674
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:05,533
Just like I did with my sword, right?

675
03:08:06,933 --> 03:08:10,200
I enchanted it, right? Wrong weapon.

676
03:08:32,133 --> 03:08:35,333
Ok, so it's just a gold shield basically. 

677
03:08:35,333 --> 03:08:38,333
Ok, so it's just a gold shield basically. 
There's nothing magical about it eh.

678
03:09:07,733 --> 03:09:13,866
I am getting an idea that The Enchanted Earth comes later on in the game, so let's go to the Asylum.

679
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:17,433
For right now.

680
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:21,700
I feel like we go back to The Enchanted Earth.

681
03:09:23,833 --> 03:09:31,233
Nothing screams "End Of Game" content other than. Shadowy.

682
03:09:31,933 --> 03:09:36,899
Demons beyond our comprehension. Right?

683
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:49,600
Absolute hell on Earth.

684
03:09:56,733 --> 03:09:59,333
Now this is dead-end as dead-ends get

685
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:01,799
This is dead as dead-ends get.

686
03:10:04,633 --> 03:10:06,966
Really nothing to do back there

687
03:11:18,433 --> 03:11:21,733
This is a combat level huh

688
03:11:23,233 --> 03:11:25,266
This is a combat level, isn't it

689
03:11:27,166 --> 03:11:30,333
After we just did a puzzle-only level pretty much

690
03:11:30,799 --> 03:11:33,333
To fight a bunch of stuff

691
03:13:47,966 --> 03:13:49,966
Well, that was fun. 

692
03:13:49,966 --> 03:13:51,833
Well, that was fun. Let's go again!

693
03:13:58,933 --> 03:14:01,866
Let's actually, refill our health

694
03:14:02,033 --> 03:14:04,766
we will do much better if we have full health.

695
03:14:07,433 --> 03:14:11,233
Let's just take out all the stops here, in order to succeed

696
03:14:16,600 --> 03:14:19,966
The easiest one at this point would be The Sleeping Village. 

697
03:14:19,966 --> 03:14:24,133
The easiest one at this point would be The Sleeping Village.
For a fountain. yeah.

698
03:14:30,033 --> 03:14:33,433
We return to where we started the stream at

699
03:14:34,299 --> 03:14:36,233
Almost 4 hours ago.

700
03:15:15,966 --> 03:15:17,799
I ought to be able to leave here right

701
03:15:51,366 --> 03:15:52,966
Not how it works 

702
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:56,633
And in that case we'll go to an easier level

703
03:16:00,033 --> 03:16:02,200
At least a shorter level

704
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:06,766
Which one would that be then

705
03:16:16,433 --> 03:16:17,733
Cemetary Hill

706
03:16:20,066 --> 03:16:22,666
Not sure if, The Graveyard might give us the

707
03:16:25,966 --> 03:16:29,966
A refill. Even though I was just there.

708
03:20:25,299 --> 03:20:28,866
Alright time to party

709
03:20:28,866 --> 03:20:30,766
Alright time to party - Thriller style

710
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:39,533
Let's wrap things up

711
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:43,933
Even though these zombies are not wrapped up in bandages.

712
03:21:07,133 --> 03:21:09,833
Oh I should've enchanted my sword again

713
03:21:17,366 --> 03:21:19,399
Let's yeah let's do that

714
03:21:36,933 --> 03:21:42,866
There is the gargoyle here although we have to finish the level for it to count right

715
03:21:46,633 --> 03:21:49,266
Back we go. 

716
03:21:49,266 --> 03:21:51,700
Back we go. That's so silly.

717
03:21:51,700 --> 03:21:54,133
Back we go. That's so silly. I'm so silly.

718
03:21:55,100 --> 03:21:58,766
I don't really think about this game

719
03:22:00,399 --> 03:22:02,133
I am a novice.

720
03:22:06,866 --> 03:22:09,566
I think a lot -of- this game. It's really good.

721
03:25:02,866 --> 03:25:05,266
Bah! Copper shield.

722
03:25:15,066 --> 03:25:19,733
Correct me if I'm wrong you couldn't repeal repair the Silver Shield right

723
03:25:20,100 --> 03:25:21,799
Could you repair your shield before? 

724
03:25:22,833 --> 03:25:29,266
'cause those shields weren't given to us from The Hall of Heroes guys. Folk.

725
03:25:30,299 --> 03:25:32,299
Yeah I'm not sure about that

726
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:54,100
Being a bit of a copycat here

727
03:29:05,166 --> 03:29:06,766
Ooh fast zombies

728
03:29:26,100 --> 03:29:27,700
We're kiting them over

729
03:30:51,799 --> 03:30:55,566
One more to go. Assuming that's correct.

730
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:06,866
Might even be a boss

731
03:31:30,133 --> 03:31:32,366
No room to run here though

732
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:46,399
And they're not stupid enough to walk into the lava

733
03:31:50,733 --> 03:31:52,433
The coals there, like...

734
03:31:54,033 --> 03:31:54,833
like...

735
03:32:09,466 --> 03:32:13,200
I wouldn't say in unintelligent, they're more 

736
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:16,299
Actually crazy.

737
03:32:18,833 --> 03:32:19,799
Yike!

738
03:32:23,233 --> 03:32:25,700
That's a thing that happens

739
03:32:28,966 --> 03:32:31,233
I'll just stay over here and pick them off

740
03:32:46,966 --> 03:32:49,466
Cool but the Chalice isn't full yet.

741
03:32:49,466 --> 03:32:50,700
Cool but the Chalice isn't full yet. Oh yeah it is, okay.

742
03:32:51,399 --> 03:32:52,066
Nice

743
03:32:56,866 --> 03:32:59,033
I fell in the magma once

744
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:00,466
Fortunately

745
03:33:03,500 --> 03:33:05,933
I got to refill again but that doesn't matter anyway

746
03:33:06,033 --> 03:33:10,433
that doesn't matter because I am going to finish the stream now we are going to be complete

747
03:33:11,733 --> 03:33:13,966
With our 4-Hour stream here

748
03:33:13,966 --> 03:33:15,133
With our 4-Hour stream here, that we're gonna

749
03:33:16,100 --> 03:33:18,799
I'm gonna get going here

750
03:33:19,466 --> 03:33:21,066
Who are you.

751
03:33:21,066 --> 03:33:22,766
Who are you. The Mad Hatter?

752
03:33:28,666 --> 03:33:31,366
Actually yeah he probably is just the Mad Hatter innit he?

753
03:34:34,799 --> 03:34:35,833
Thanks mayor

754
03:34:39,133 --> 03:34:41,766
I'm sorry I thought you were a.

755
03:34:43,866 --> 03:34:47,799
Mad Hatter, though. You do look very eccentric.

756
03:34:56,533 --> 03:34:58,433
That everything then?

757
03:34:58,433 --> 03:35:00,366
That everything then? Got the Chalice.

758
03:35:00,366 --> 03:35:02,799
That everything then? Got the Chalice. A...

759
03:35:02,799 --> 03:35:05,566
That everything then? Got the Chalice. A Dragon Gem.

760
03:35:06,200 --> 03:35:07,100
Ooh.

761
03:35:07,766 --> 03:35:11,833
I think I know what that's for just making a guess here.

762
03:35:17,633 --> 03:35:18,700
Potentially.

763
03:35:20,133 --> 03:35:22,666
Might just be for the shadow.

764
03:35:27,366 --> 03:35:29,399
Shadow monsters

765
03:35:46,100 --> 03:35:46,899
Yeah sure

766
03:35:49,133 --> 03:35:53,799
I wasn't wrong about that - the more you have your sword out,

767
03:35:54,866 --> 03:35:58,200
the more it loses its enchantment

768
03:36:02,866 --> 03:36:08,399
I left it out while I was away and it just wasn't enchanted when I came back

769
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:12,866
Repair the Gold Sh‒ Yeah that's, good.

770
03:37:37,933 --> 03:37:39,033
Alrighty

771
03:37:40,133 --> 03:37:44,799
Yeah I think we need to go back to the enchanted forest I think that's what the Dragon Gem's for.

772
03:37:46,533 --> 03:37:51,366
But I'm not going to do any, anymore of that level
I just want to see if it does anything.

773
03:38:08,200 --> 03:38:16,399
Seems like we need four of something in order to do the shadow, tomb, demon place.

774
03:38:33,899 --> 03:38:35,033
This was fun

775
03:38:35,933 --> 03:38:38,533
I made a lot more progress

776
03:38:40,399 --> 03:38:43,633
Than I thought I would in 4 hours... But, pretty good

777
03:38:44,299 --> 03:38:45,566
Pre‒tty good.

778
03:39:13,399 --> 03:39:17,899
Actually we have two paths in the forest, still, here

779
03:39:24,533 --> 03:39:27,100
There appears to be two different ways we can go

780
03:39:30,600 --> 03:39:32,500
Curious. Is...?

781
03:39:36,633 --> 03:39:40,633
It would totally say if...

782
03:39:40,633 --> 03:39:42,433
It would totally say if, I could use this here

783
03:39:42,600 --> 03:39:44,266
It is not saying anything.

784
03:39:58,933 --> 03:40:00,100
I'm not going to

785
03:40:00,100 --> 03:40:03,799
I'm not going to, no healing.
I can't finish this level, right

786
03:42:49,433 --> 03:42:53,399
Right. It is also a puzzle. It's a matter of order.

787
03:42:57,633 --> 03:43:00,633
OK. I get it.

788
03:43:06,066 --> 03:43:07,733
Cool.

789
03:43:07,733 --> 03:43:10,666
Cool. I think. I think this is cool?

790
03:43:15,566 --> 03:43:17,366
That doesn't seem like it

791
03:43:29,500 --> 03:43:34,333
And now we must catch all the ghosts‒ I mean, destroy the Shadows right?

792
03:43:34,933 --> 03:43:39,466
We didn't unleash any Luigi's Mansion-esque monsters upon us

793
03:43:39,633 --> 03:43:41,700
This is much more serious than that

794
03:43:41,899 --> 03:43:44,666
But I'm going to I'm going to call the stream

795
03:43:46,333 --> 03:43:47,633
Call it here

796
03:43:50,833 --> 03:43:52,100
Go ahead and

797
03:43:57,166 --> 03:44:02,299
Gonna go ahead and click end because I don't really have any music tonight, and

798
03:44:09,700 --> 03:44:13,200
I'd like to do a few things before I go to bed so

799
03:44:13,366 --> 03:44:17,133
Get right to that. Thanks for watching.
