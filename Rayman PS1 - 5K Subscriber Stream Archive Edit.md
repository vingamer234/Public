On a Thursday! [#rayman](https://bsky.app/hashtag/rayman) Rayman!  <br><br/>alt text:  <br><br/>vingamer's Gaming stream video thumbnail (archive edit). image split into two halves. — Text: (left-most) "vingamer's Gaming". vertical text logo. (right, top to bottom) "Archive". "Rayman!". <br><br>Image Description: (left) A game screenshot of Rayman (PlayStation, 1995), a sprite-based 2D platformer with a hand-drawn art style. The first level of the game, Pink Plant Woods. The bright environment has dark water near Rayman, who is standing on a grassy platform surrounded the water, with more grass to the right of him. There is one sparkling Ting collectable that the player can jump up and collect, while jumping far enough to avoid failing in the water. 3 bright blue wingtail butterflies flutter near the Ting. Greyish-brown stones in the water break up the backdrop and the playable space. <br><br>Background: a light blue lake with cattails and mushrooms growing up out of it. Distant foliage, with a tall green tree with green leaves in the lake, against the shore - and purple and dark pink ferns. |     |
