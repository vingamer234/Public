Set sail for a whale! ▼ More Below… I've got a whale bone to pick with Pinocchio. First of all, he was a stowaway on the Gummi Ship evidentially— And now I have a bone to pick with Donald Duck. What happened to "world order"? Hmph, you wouldn't let Riku join us, but somehow you miss someone so clackety? How could this happen?

<br/><br/>If it weren't for the treasure chest, I'd think Pinocchio took that Gummi Block from Cid. I mean if it saves Geppetto, fine, I guess. The two old guys can talk Gummi Ships back in Traverse Town… Yes, I know Cid is 30.

From Kingdom Hearts Final Mix (2021, HD). ‒ Traverse Town world, indoor room inside of the Accessory Shop, on the floor to the side of the shop counter. The player is meeting the wooden boy Pinocchio (from Disney's "Pinocchio", 1940), Jiminy Cricket, on the right, is talking with Pinocchio. Pinocchio's speech bubble reads: "a present.". ‒ There is a graphic of a wrapped present between the two characters (which is normally a Prize orb, or common Item, in this spot by Pinocchio). Both the speech bubble and the present were modified with graphics editing program. |     |
