On a Thursday! [#rayman](https://bsky.app/hashtag/rayman) Rayman!  <br><br/>alt text:  <br><br/>vingamer's Gaming stream video thumbnail (archive edit). image split into two halves. — Text: (left-most) "vingamer's Gaming". vertical text logo. (right, top to bottom) "Archive". "Rayman!". <br><br>Image Description: (left) A game screenshot of Rayman (PlayStation, 1995), a sprite-based 2D platformer with a hand-drawn art style. The first level of the game, Pink Plant Woods. The bright environment has dark water near Rayman, who is standing on a grassy platform surrounded the water, with more grass to the right of him. There is one sparkling Ting collectable that the player can jump up and collect, while jumping far enough to avoid failing in the water. 3 bright blue wingtail butterflies flutter near the Ting. Greyish-brown stones in the water break up the backdrop and the playable space. <br><br>Background: a light blue lake with cattails and mushrooms growing up out of it. Distant foliage, with a tall green tree with green leaves in the lake, against the shore - and purple and dark pink ferns. |     |

Vertical video thumbnail for Rayman (1995) PlayStation video game. 
Band Land world hub of levels, the level name is "Bongo Hills". (level 2-1) A musical themed world. This is level five overall in the game. The gameplay screenshot is overlaid in front of a purple Rayman 1 themed background. — 
Screenshot shows the third part ("act") of the level. Rayman has reached the second checkpoint here. Multiple spiky blue hazards that have eyes are lined up near drum instrument platform ceiling, where the maraca rocket platform is stopped against. Rayman was just riding this maraca up and jumped off. The checkpoints in this game are depicted as photo cutout standees of a muscular surfer character, like Rayman (with no limbs). The standee has a cutout, where Rayman shows his head and smiles for a photo. * — 
Backdrop Description: Blue sky fading to a small amount of pink, with light lavender-gray clouds. Green tall hills, one has a treble clef on its surface. Closer to the playable area are green bushy trees, that surround a brown harp instrument. — * More Info: The cutout picture has the character on a picture of a beach, holding a surfboard in one hand, sunglasses in the other, and a blue, single white striped, beach towel over the top of the torso's "shoulder". There's a palm tree in the cutout picture too. The photographer character is to the side of the standee holding their camera.</span>
