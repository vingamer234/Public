00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Hello. Hello. Welcome to stream.

3
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,960
Welcome back. It's been a bit been a

4
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,799
while.

5
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,680
Not only since I've streamed any game,

6
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079
but we haven't streamed MediEvil since

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,159
uh Halloween. Thought we'd come back to

8
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,079
it. Honestly, I didn't have anything

9
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
else

10
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,640
planned.

11
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,520
things kind of worked out in a way that

12
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,520
this game made sense

13
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,200
to to go back to.

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,879
We're not going that direction. We are

15
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:16,040
going to the Sleeping Village. Uh figure

16
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,040
out how to get there. right here.

17
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
One more should be it. I remember the

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,800
Pumpkin Gorge.

19
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,040
Where was it?

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,959
Must be back this way.

21
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:03,319
I see the circle glowing. I think

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,319
here that's the Enchanted Earth. Close.

23
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,560
There we go. There we go.

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,560
All right,

25
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,400
get into it.

26
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,680
Let's get into the game. Let's get

27
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,680
undead again.

28
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,000
How could something be undead twice?

29
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,080
Yay, my sword's enchanted again. I was

30
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
wondering why it went a—

31
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,319
>> Poor villagers

32
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,239
>> thought it lost its magic

33
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,239
>> It mustn't hurt them. Hurt guards though.

34
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,840
All right.

35
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,160
Fill up our magic, our health potions

36
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
again.

37
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,520
>> A crucifix once stood here, but the

38
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:58,759
mayor took it. Find a replacement and

39
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,759
see how the church should really look.

40
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,280
Really do need to figure out which way

41
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,280
to go here.

42
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,199

45
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,479
Green of Gallows Town was awarded Smithy

46
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,120
of the season by our readers. His

47
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,680
outstanding casts have produced many

48
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,880
intricate and hardwearing iron goods and

49
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,039
sculptures. Willy only uses the finest

50
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,759
of metals in his work and is

51
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,680
particularly noted for his magnificent

52
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,960
busts.

53
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,199
Old man Willy was quoted as saying,

54
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,759
"Aye when I get pumping on me bellows,

55
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,680
there's no stopping me. It's all in the

56
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,759
rhythm. Up and down, up and down. I've

57
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,360
always been inspired by the stories of

58
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,160
Stanyer Iron Hewer, the greatest Smithy

59
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,160
there ever was."

60
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,720
>> Uh, haven't had any damage on our

61
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:29,680
already existing silver shield. So,

62
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,759
supposedly I I believe there's a there's

63
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,160
an element of getting stuff when you

64
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,599
actually need it in this game, but I

65
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,360
don't know this game well enough to know

66
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,440
where everything's at. So,

67
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,440
Okay. Anything in here though? The

68
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,440
bellows.

69
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,000
Feel like knowing this game already

70
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,840
through the levels we've been through, I

71
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,720
need something else to complete this

72
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,800
puzzle. So, so to speak, there's

73
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,240
something more to the bellows. Probably

74
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,240
we need something to smith uh here.

75
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Probably

76
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,400
me double check the book though.

intricate and hardwearing.

and Taz.

84
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,719
I feel like there's something more to

85
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,440
that that we have to do than where we

86
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,440
started.

87
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,720
Benefit of Dan's head being able to go

88
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:54,519
360 is he can look at any enemies that

89
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,519
are nearby for us.

90
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,200
Got our Moon Rune.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Is that a trap?

92
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,640
Okay, I didn't do anything.

93
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Barrels.

94
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,200
I could see this game trapping us to

95
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,720
taking out any innocents here. Where's

96
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,279
our uh Where's the Chalice meter? There

97
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,279
it is. 61.

98
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
Believe that's where it starts at.

99
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,440
Okay, that probably opens the cellar

100
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,440
here.

101
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,320
The rats drop stuff. I think

102
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,200
Mhm.

103
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,200
Come on.

104
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,959
Believe [that] got banned. Okay. Sorry.

105
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,399
The rats.

106
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,519
The rats seem to not be affected by our

107
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,519
hammering.

108
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Just give us a club though.

109
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,640
For some reason, why would I need a club

110
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,640
at this point? I have a hammer.

111
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,000
Maybe it can go out of order in terms of

112
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,000
uh the levels.

113
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,880
Uh can you move, miss?

114
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,880
Ma'am, can you move when you wake up,

115
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,880
please?

116
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,079
I would like to read this book.

117
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,399
There

120
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,480
the pedestal.

121
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,200
>> Statue, eh?

122
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,279
shield. Do I have an

123
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,600
No,

124
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,600
no bronze shield anywhere in sight.

125
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,480
Not seeing how I would lower this.

126
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,240
I'm going to take my rune and get out of

127
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
here.

128
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,160
Oh, it's in the same building, so it's

129
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,040
probably related.

130
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,040
That's all you have to do.

131
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,800
Cool. Cool. Always

132
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,040
love some multi-level game play.

my god.

139
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,079
Well, we take the bust. I think I think

140
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,079
we take the bust to here now.

141
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:21,399
Do not stand in the uh

142
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,399
lava. Okay.

143
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,399
It cannot be used

144
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,600
other side.

145
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,880
Okay, this probably... Was this?

146
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,440
What do we need in here again?

147
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,800
Ah, I'm stuck on the cand— candlestick.

148
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,800
Oh dear.

149
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,600
Why do I always find the glitches in

150
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,600
these games?

151
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,919
ridiculous.

152
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:40,360
I don't have captions on.

153
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,360
Needed to set that before stream

154
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,720
for Twitch.

155
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,919
Good.

156
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,919
Yes. Yes.

157
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:58,966
I'm kind of stuck here aren't I I really
don't think there's anything I can do other
than restarting

158
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,666
Jeez Louise

159
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,133
Ridiculous

160
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:25,033
The butcher we need to find the butchery.
Where ever that might be at.

161
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,933
That's why I'm going to call it

162
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,900
Here it is.

163
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:43,366
No sign on that so this just regular house. ok

164
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:48,733
Believe we need that to go in there anyway.

165
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:00,733
I haven't been out here yet

166
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,166
They are faster than me almost

167
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,466
Even the big guy

168
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,333
Here it is

169
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,333
This should be it. Sack.

170
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,266
Back 'bout

171
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:49,599
Like a meat a meat house

172
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:59,500
You don't want to go in there quite yet. I might
get my ass handed to me

173
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:05,400
Okay now I'm ready

174
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:09,166
More danger upstairs.

175
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,533
Away from the barrels so I can

176
00:21:22,766 --> 00:21:24,400
Perfect.

177
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,833
Okay I don't need... Can I get in

178
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:38,033
61. I haven't killed anyone yet

179
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,099
Doot doot doot doot dooooo

180
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,633
That was the blacksmith because the guy was
renowned for making busts, which of

181
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,466
one of which we have

182
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:26,466
But I don't think we would go there because
it's already it's already made so

183
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:33,866
Skip...

184
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,666
...The rope. They're like machines so they
don't add to the Chalice right. Do they?

185
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:45,333
Are they enchanted? They are, okay.

186
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,133
Made with, uh, magic. Dark magic from,

187
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:52,599
What's-his-face

188
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:12,833
Chaos Rune. I bet the Chaos Rune is outside the village.

189
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,333
Gonna wager a guess that's where it's at

190
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:28,299
I would think a hammer's good on these

191
00:23:39,366 --> 00:23:41,966
Throwing daggers and crossbow.

192
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:44,433
It's not going to work well an armor.

193
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,066
Down here

194
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:18,900
Library

195
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,633
So interesting

196
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:22,599
And now I get hit.

197
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,766
Hit by the butcher. Great.

198
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,000
All of that: No no.

199
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,299
I do not want. *scoff*

200
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:28,033
Especially the dragon toads.

201
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:33,666
Oop. Back to the, church.

202
00:29:01,233 --> 00:29:02,799
That's where the blacksmith comes in

203
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:12,166
I think I'll skip reading anything else I'll
come back later on my own time

204
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,366
Get these bones rolling

205
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:26,366
How do I get outside the village? That door's shut already?

206
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,400
I saw an exit

207
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:37,966
But we need something to make and we have the...

208
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,266
We already have stuff to make it with

209
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,666
A furnace thing.

210
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,299
Perhaps not

211
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,433
Using it

212
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:18,466
Need to do more

213
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,333
If I could just melt the statue I already have
I can get gold for the,

214
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:51,866
Crucifix.

215
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,166
Maybe I need to combine them? Like do them—

216
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:05,233
There's‒ this must be the gateway I need to go through

217
00:32:09,466 --> 00:32:11,099
Oh, it's over here

218
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,266
Explore some more

219
00:32:16,033 --> 00:32:17,200
"I see you!"

220
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:29,733
[continued accent]
Gonna lay ya out with one blow, I am!

221
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:36,666
'hop you right in half with my axe!

222
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:39,566
Wa‒ ter

223
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:41,333
Ah...

224
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:44,799
Something underwater.

225
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:56,900
Nothin- nothing here quite yet. I think,

226
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:02,933
Maybe the shadow rune will. Something here. I don't
know.

227
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:07,933
[with accent]
When I get mah hands on him

228
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:35,466
It's a roof tile or something on top of
that awning

229
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,366
OK, what do I do here?

230
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,366
That's a pretty color for the...

231
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,266
where...? Oh, it changes~

232
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,466
[chuckling] Holiday cookies

233
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,866
A way to open the gate

234
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:09,633
Oh was there something in there?
There was a, uh

235
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,800
That's stained glass, I thought there was a potion

236
00:34:13,966 --> 00:34:15,466
Something else glowy

237
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:17,333
Is all

238
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:24,633
[exhaling]

239
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,966
Maybe I'm supposed to read

240
00:34:31,066 --> 00:34:32,566
I didn't want to read.

241
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,933
That's the exit, I persume

242
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,566
head

243
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:57,533
Like Chernabog

244
00:35:36,266 --> 00:35:37,666
Reading it is

245
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,199
The books do stay open

246
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,433
I'll put this in the right order when I edit this

247
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,833
I'm going backwards

248
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,300
Doesn't appreciate the finer arts of reading

249
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:14,566
And if you recall, I think all that was
probably spurred on by his dead puppy

250
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:17,533
Shame that.

251
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,966
As a child he got into alchemy, is... *hmpf*

252
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:23,766
Probably! I don't know.

253
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,400
Well that is obviously not it. There is no
lore-driven gameplay here.

254
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,500
Where do I go next

255
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,533
I am wondering I will try to figure it out
on my own though

256
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:44,533
Libraries done

257
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,800
I keep on seeing "Trolls Head".

258
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,400
Don't know what that means. Like a tavern?

259
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:02,566
Door I haven't went through yet.

260
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,233
Is this, that's just the house. Yeah.

261
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,500
I can't go underwater that is a certainty

262
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:21,033
Nothing outside; that pond is not where we need to
go

263
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:24,966
Out of my way please. Thank you.

264
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,633
You're... Just fine

265
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:29,300
You-you're fine

266
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,033
I mean,

267
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,933
Not really, you're kind of possessed right
now, but

268
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:38,266
We'll‒ I'll take care of that. Sir Daniel Fortesque will.

269
00:41:38,433 --> 00:41:39,199
We'll‒ I'll take care of that. Sir Daniel Fortesque will.

270
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:47,466
There... I think we just need to go to the.

271
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:48,866
There... I think we just need to go to the. Blacksmith.

272
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:51,633
Must be missing something.

273
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:57,800
As usual I am missing something

274
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,800
We just have a cast so we can't go to the

275
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,900
-That- area

276
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,500
Not going to do us any good

277
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,099
Need an actual, crucifix

278
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:40,766
Maybe this really is like Bugs Bunny & Taz;
maybe I have to jump on this a lot more than I was.

279
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:56,800
The light changing in here, or is that just my
imagination

280
00:43:16,233 --> 00:43:18,466
Boy speedrunning this level must be fun

281
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,033
I thought there would be some sort of
indication but

282
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,466
Indeed. Could be.

283
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,033
Ohh!

284
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:49,666
You have to do it in front

285
00:44:56,699 --> 00:44:58,199
And melt the gold down

286
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:01,933
Again - in front of the forge.

287
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,300
To be fair it does prompt me what to do here

288
00:45:12,266 --> 00:45:13,800
I just wasn't seeing it

289
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:33,300
Ta-daaaa!

290
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:42,800
Banish all evil

291
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,133
Except for the big, mech guys

292
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,400
Well, almost.

293
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,266
Well, almost. You'd think that would do something.

294
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,933
I guess that's cool

295
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,133
Heh heh heh heh‒

296
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:45,033
Are we going to do something... unsmart here

297
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:52,766
But like I know these Shadow Demons.
I think I've seen them before in gameplay

298
00:46:57,699 --> 00:47:01,433
OK I'll be right back. Not going to leave this,

299
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:05,466
room, here, in case I end up getting...

300
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,533
Destroyed by something that appears now that we've done this

301
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,300
Heidi ho

302
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:01,633
Let's-a go

303
00:49:43,433 --> 00:49:45,333
Ah, we looped around here

304
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,599
The other side of this gate now.

305
00:50:06,433 --> 00:50:07,966
Goods around here?

306
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,300
There's the Chalice

307
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:17,733
A potion.

308
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:21,466
do do

309
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:31,533
Gate from this side now

310
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,766
They do drop gold

311
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:06,166
One gold

312
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,500
I'll buy so much with that one piece of gold

313
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,033
Get in through the roof...

314
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,199
Ah! Probably.

315
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,033
[Looks] like a vault

316
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,566
We will unleash heck

317
00:52:42,699 --> 00:52:43,633
upon the Earth.

318
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:47,699
Probably

319
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:56,966
Soon, soon - eventually we will. This is just the shadow...

320
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,066
have a key for

321
00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:02,099
"No safe is safe."

322
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:04,699
Especially this one

323
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:11,433
chateau artifact

324
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:12,433
Chateau.

325
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,133
Is this a chateau, a shadow chateau? Cuz it's a
house?

326
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,133
Seems to have no other significance

327
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:35,099
Okay I got to go bash some.

328
00:53:35,699 --> 00:53:38,866
Mechancial heads in and we can get the...

329
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:41,666
Chalice

330
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:45,900
Oh did the gate open?

331
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:49,666
How convenient. How convenient, thank you gate.

332
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,199
Must have been linked to the switch

333
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,366
100% per-cent. Percent

334
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:56,300
Avoid the dragon toads. Do not touch them.

335
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,900
We go right, for the witch

336
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:21,500
There's multiple paths to go down. I think we'll will go with the

337
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,333
There's multiple paths to go down. I think we'll will go with the, the ant tunnels first?

338
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,366
Ope‒ that's, that's not good!

339
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,766
That is one path we do *not* want to go down.

340
01:00:44,133 --> 01:00:46,699
Wrong book. Wrong

341
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:47,566
Wrong book. Wrong thing.

342
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,266
I like the fairies are following us here,

343
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,566
ones we've rescued.

344
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:16,033
It's very easy to toggle off the HUD

345
01:11:18,333 --> 01:11:21,066
It's mapped to the

346
01:11:21,233 --> 01:11:22,300
L3 button.

347
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:40,800
Setting for the 30 FPS didn't persist, but pretty sure it's usually 30 FPS anyway on a regular PlayStation 4, so...

348
01:11:45,366 --> 01:11:49,199
We're doing two things down here, one of which we just completed

349
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:51,366
Got enough amber for the witch.

350
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:06,066
I know what that means!

351
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:09,600
[And] me without a shield

352
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,399
Look at the pretty fairies

353
01:12:39,766 --> 01:12:43,566
I believe this level was pretty notorious back in the day

354
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,433
For being hard to get through.

355
01:12:47,066 --> 01:12:50,133
Looks much better in this version though

356
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,699
I feel like that's the case.

357
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:02,666
Solder ants here

358
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:06,199
Oh dear

359
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:29,066
Not too sure if I'm just bad at this game, or if it's really difficult

360
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:32,699
Little bit of column A, little bit of column B.

361
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:14,066
Bows here aren't really going to help us because they're so fast, these ants

362
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:18,333
They stay on us very easily

363
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:23,066
Feel like our strategy of just using a sword's probably for the best

364
01:14:35,366 --> 01:14:42,266
If I die again we'll go back and refill our health a little bit more if I can, if I can do that.

365
01:14:43,633 --> 01:14:49,133
"Thank you for releasing me."
Oh really? You're doing that, doing the thank you for releasing me thing

366
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:54,566
You know what you're doing, fairy

367
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:59,166
You know what time your game came out in

368
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,899
Yeah it was a lot darker in the PS1 version.

369
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:35,833
Yeah it was a lot darker in the PS1 version.
That, I know of.

370
01:15:36,433 --> 01:15:38,500
Open ze chest.

371
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:25,500
I've already been live long enough to be‒

372
01:17:25,733 --> 01:17:28,533
This stream has been longer than the last one.

373
01:17:28,533 --> 01:17:30,033
This stream has been longer than the last one.
[Of] this game.

374
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:32,233
A lot of enemies here

375
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:54,233
Almost like the hit boxes on these ants
are too short to hit with the stronger attack

376
01:21:17,366 --> 01:21:19,066
Did we just go in circles?

377
01:21:22,066 --> 01:21:24,800
Well that's easy to do in these

378
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,133
Labyrinth-like tunnels. Jeez.

379
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:35,533
That's one thing they kept true to the
original game. Confusing.

380
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:45,866
I had enough trouble in the village!

381
01:21:55,633 --> 01:21:59,233
I'm not going to bother with strong attacks

382
01:21:59,233 --> 01:22:01,199
I'm not going to bother with strong attacks.
They don't seem to connect.

383
01:22:54,733 --> 01:22:59,066
Oh you have a jump attack as Dan, too

384
01:22:59,866 --> 01:23:03,000
You have some sort of jump attack, it's more of a stab.

385
01:23:04,566 --> 01:23:05,866
Be good to know

386
01:24:25,933 --> 01:24:30,133
Have a lot of sort of fossilized remains down here

387
01:24:30,633 --> 01:24:34,433
Seen some ammonites

388
01:24:36,666 --> 01:24:39,600
Trilobites... Amber of course

389
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,866
The hammer does deal more damage

390
01:25:13,966 --> 01:25:15,733
Two hits versus three

391
01:25:18,833 --> 01:25:24,833
Unless the sword might be enchanted sometimes that would be, when you want to use it.

392
01:25:26,033 --> 01:25:28,399
I started off with it,

393
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:29,633
I started off with it, being a good idea

394
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,100
We're getting through this a little bit better now

395
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:37,033
The sword is faster, though

396
01:26:39,866 --> 01:26:43,766
You keep on using your hammer, you're going to be open to attacks more

397
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:55,500
These guys… Probably a good idea not to be open to attacks, they're very fast.

398
01:27:05,833 --> 01:27:08,866
Like I've found a way forward without too much
trouble

399
01:27:21,566 --> 01:27:24,833
Ah, we're being overachievers now are we?

400
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,000
This is very pretty

401
01:27:40,933 --> 01:27:42,899
I don't like, what

402
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,766
I don't like that though, that looks ominous

403
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:54,566
I could tell when there's a boss up ahead

404
01:29:09,166 --> 01:29:12,266
The telltale signs of something dangerous

405
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:32,733
How wonderful.

406
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:36,833
ooh

407
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:39,433
[repelled]
ooh.

408
01:29:45,699 --> 01:29:49,433
Hmm, yeah there's there's an ant somewhere here.

409
01:30:18,233 --> 01:30:22,433
And I don't have a shield. This is not going to be…

410
01:30:23,433 --> 01:30:26,100
Clean. This is not going to be clean, I bet.

411
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:31,399
At least I have an enchanted sword now

412
01:30:34,966 --> 01:30:39,133
Got a weak point, or a charge up attack? Okay.

413
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:50,333
OK I probably want a ranged weapon -this- time around

414
01:31:08,466 --> 01:31:12,966
Actually it's both: A weak spot and it's charging its a charge up

415
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,366
Why don't you crush the ants

416
01:32:59,566 --> 01:33:01,500
Yeah!!

417
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,633
"Antagonist"! [chuckle]

418
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:13,300
That went better than expected I almost died. I came, I came within the

419
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:17,066
That went better than expected I almost died. I came, I came within the range of dying, but uh

420
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:20,433
Let's deal with this guy rather.

421
01:33:20,933 --> 01:33:21,966
Jesus

422
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:31,000
so's the aforementioned dying

423
01:33:32,466 --> 01:33:38,100
Fortunately they give us some health, or is, is that that a teleport

424
01:33:41,933 --> 01:33:43,566
I think that's an exit

425
01:33:47,633 --> 01:33:51,199
Am I stuck down here though, I feel like I missed a...

426
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,566
I am stuck down here.

427
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:00,733
A victorious retreat

428
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,199
You fairies can be saved next time.

429
01:34:47,033 --> 01:34:48,366
Now that's going to be helpful

430
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,866
we'll find out what it is

431
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:53,399
once we go to a new level.

432
01:34:53,833 --> 01:34:55,800
I think we'll just go ahead and go

433
01:34:56,033 --> 01:35:00,433
 let's explore the enchanted grounds a little bit more

434
01:35:02,666 --> 01:35:04,766
If I can get to it

435
01:35:06,433 --> 01:35:07,800
There we go.

436
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,833
The enchanted grounds, the Enchanted Earth. Soil.

437
01:35:19,966 --> 01:35:21,266
"Detritus"?

438
01:35:22,433 --> 01:35:23,500
detritus

439
01:35:24,733 --> 01:35:27,866
Is that a word, detritus?

440
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:29,366
I don't know how to say that

441
01:35:34,966 --> 01:35:38,866
That's too big of a word for me to actually pronounce correctly.

442
01:35:38,866 --> 01:35:40,366
That's too big of a word for me to actually pronounce correctly. Too smart.

443
01:35:42,766 --> 01:35:44,600
I shall retreat.

444
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,300
What are you doing…

445
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:50,066
What are you doing…
Dan is that a chicken?

446
01:35:50,899 --> 01:35:53,500
Pull out a chicken

447
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:56,733
Pulled out an emergency chicken.  For some reason.

448
01:36:08,033 --> 01:36:09,333
If I if I if I,

449
01:36:09,433 --> 01:36:15,266
Take myself out will I get health back or
will I just respawn almost dead again

450
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,399
Let's find out!

451
01:36:18,566 --> 01:36:20,566
"Shadow Demons"…

452
01:36:20,733 --> 01:36:24,066
Is this linked to the, we need the shadow

453
01:36:24,066 --> 01:36:30,966
yeah that's the, the Shadow Artifact will let us get the Shadow Demons opened.

454
01:36:31,866 --> 01:36:34,633
The Tomb of the Shadows, if you will

455
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,933
"Tomb of the Ancients", yeah.

456
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:46,699
Nice, Rayman...

457
01:36:50,766 --> 01:36:55,633
*I* didn't set the chicken drumstick to anything, it just appeared

458
01:36:59,966 --> 01:37:01,566
Embrace the toads

459
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:12,699
Emergency life bottle

460
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,233
The very least I'll get a full health bar.

461
01:37:20,633 --> 01:37:22,633
Wouldn't leave me with nothing would you

462
01:38:12,233 --> 01:38:14,233
It left me with nothing.

463
01:38:14,899 --> 01:38:16,766
This is the, uh

464
01:38:18,933 --> 01:38:21,866
This is "Dark Souls" before Dark Souls was a
thing

465
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:37,633
Where is an easy to get to fountain

466
01:38:44,066 --> 01:38:48,600
I suppose Cemetery... Return to the Graveyard?

467
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,100
Actually I just think, uh

468
01:39:00,333 --> 01:39:02,033
The Graveyard would be it

469
01:39:11,033 --> 01:39:14,733
Actually multiple ones there, being the first level and all

470
01:39:20,833 --> 01:39:25,566
So what did I do over my month break of streaming - from streaming?

471
01:39:27,266 --> 01:39:30,500
I played some more Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled

472
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,533
Get some pit stop progress, didn't...

473
01:39:36,766 --> 01:39:40,199
unlocked a few things, one new character

474
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:44,066
Nothing too exciting though

475
01:39:47,966 --> 01:39:57,066
I got a, a single Velo time trial, in Coco
Park - one of the easiest tracks in the game.

476
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,600
First Velo time trial ghost I beat.

477
01:40:00,766 --> 01:40:07,433
OK, so there should be easy to get fountain and also easy to avoid enemies right

478
01:40:09,533 --> 01:40:11,833
Won't be dying anytime soon here

479
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,066
Can't catch me some zombs.

480
01:40:15,066 --> 01:40:16,333
Can't catch me some zombs. Zombles

481
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,366
There, money

482
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:21,833
I will take that again.

483
01:40:37,733 --> 01:40:41,833
Why do I have a chicken drumstick again? What is with the chicken?

484
01:40:47,566 --> 01:40:50,000
Oh you do have a charge shot, cool

485
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:59,133
There's one more fountain in this area

486
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,899
I believe

487
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:06,433
Unless the graveyard does get split up and I'm thinking of that level

488
01:41:17,366 --> 01:41:18,633
Rune

489
01:43:04,166 --> 01:43:05,133
Here we are

490
01:44:53,733 --> 01:44:55,699
Hello I am back

491
01:45:02,066 --> 01:45:03,399
Where we going next

492
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:12,699
We're gonna explore more of the Enchanted Earth

493
01:45:13,366 --> 01:45:15,066
Without being

494
01:45:20,033 --> 01:45:21,866
Susceptible to death

495
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:36,300
That's noooo good

496
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:41,100
Chat I don't find myself...

497
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:45,566
Chat I don't find myself very commonly in this situation,

498
01:45:45,566 --> 01:45:50,633
but what do you do when there's a cat that wants your attention and you're trying to play a game?

499
01:45:51,699 --> 01:45:53,133
Do you ignore the cat?

500
01:45:54,233 --> 01:45:56,566
So I see the captions aren't working

501
01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:59,933
But I am talking, and it's coming through,

502
01:45:59,933 --> 01:46:02,333
But I am talking, and it's coming through,
Sooo, let's reset that

503
01:46:04,933 --> 01:46:07,933
Let's reset that and it get working

504
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:21,333
Should be better okay that's better

505
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,466
So those ants that we killed in the tunnels down there

506
01:46:30,266 --> 01:46:34,899
They didn't count towards the Chalice, so that's technically a separate level entirely

507
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:40,300
But we definitely have stuff to do here because we have a Shadow

508
01:46:42,733 --> 01:46:43,566
...Artifact

509
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
What did the witch give us? Let's find out

510
01:46:52,733 --> 01:46:54,399
What did we get from the witch?

511
01:46:54,933 --> 01:46:56,533
We get anything good?

512
01:46:56,733 --> 01:46:59,466
Did... She give me a chicken drumstick? Is that why I had that equipped?

513
01:47:03,699 --> 01:47:05,000
That is hilarious.

514
01:47:11,433 --> 01:47:13,233
Why.

515
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:16,166
It's so useless

516
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:18,566
What am I supposed to do with that

517
01:47:26,166 --> 01:47:27,100
Ok

518
01:47:57,366 --> 01:48:01,300
What's more economical the crossbow or the longbow

519
01:48:17,466 --> 01:48:20,966
'Course we can get the witch summoned again if we want

520
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,600
If we want to go down there but I don't want to do that anymore.

521
01:48:27,266 --> 01:48:29,066
Too claustrophobic down there

522
01:48:34,233 --> 01:48:36,866
I don't I think I'd rather go with the bow here

523
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:41,000
The game seems to do that a lot

524
01:48:43,133 --> 01:48:47,633
Get something new, the old weapon just kind of becomes,

525
01:48:47,633 --> 01:48:50,433
Get something new the old weapon just kind of becomes pointless to use.

526
01:48:52,866 --> 01:48:56,600
Oh if you run out of ammo then there'd be a good reason to go—

527
01:48:56,766 --> 01:48:58,600
None shall pass!

528
01:49:02,899 --> 01:49:05,533
Ah that's probably the

529
01:49:08,566 --> 01:49:11,100
Probably related to the artifact huh -

530
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:20,933
guardians keeping us out.

531
01:49:21,699 --> 01:49:23,699
Where does this go?

532
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:25,066
Where does this go?
Nowhere.

533
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:51,699
A golden dragon egg

534
01:50:04,166 --> 01:50:07,766
That's where we got the Witch's

535
01:50:07,766 --> 01:50:09,633
That's where we got the Witch's Talisman,

536
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:11,033
Cemetery Hill.

537
01:50:31,366 --> 01:50:33,866
A small detail I thought I heard there

538
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:41,566
Must have been Sir Dan's armor

539
01:50:45,566 --> 01:50:47,066
Clanking around

540
01:50:47,833 --> 01:50:51,166
Going in here yet? Course not.

541
01:50:51,366 --> 01:50:54,899
Guess we do need to go up to the treetops

542
01:51:28,233 --> 01:51:32,833
And I'll go ahead and tell you right now the the
goblet-

543
01:51:33,033 --> 01:51:35,566
What's this thing called? The goblet

544
01:51:36,066 --> 01:51:39,300
What what... the uh, the uh

545
01:51:43,466 --> 01:51:48,300
The drinky thingy, you want to kill the Shadow Demons to fill it this time

546
01:51:48,433 --> 01:51:51,033
everything else doesn't do any good

547
01:51:54,866 --> 01:51:57,100
Our health is full.

548
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:59,166
Our health is full. Nearly.

549
01:51:59,166 --> 01:52:01,100
Our health is full. Nearly.
Might as well be.

550
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:26,000
Oh did I find some treasure

551
01:52:35,566 --> 01:52:37,899
Oh that's very hidden

552
01:52:40,233 --> 01:52:41,100
Go on the other side

553
01:52:42,466 --> 01:52:44,600
Hey kind of

554
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:48,133
Not really

555
01:52:52,300 --> 01:52:57,466
I feel like I'm quiet again in terms of comparing it to the game's

556
01:52:57,633 --> 01:52:58,899
Turn it down a bit

557
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:03,000
I've been keeping an eye on it

558
01:53:43,633 --> 01:53:46,666
How quickly am I going to get attacked by things

559
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,699
These are dragon eggs and they're going to be dragons, right

560
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:14,066
What a cool level

561
01:54:24,100 --> 01:54:27,166
A nest. What was noise?

562
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,500
Talons

563
01:54:48,199 --> 01:54:50,533
Look at the book entry, here

564
01:54:57,033 --> 01:54:58,833
Get a trophy for all this stuff

565
01:54:58,833 --> 01:55:00,300
Get a trophy for all this stuff. Probably.

566
01:55:03,699 --> 01:55:04,899
Dragon Bird

567
01:55:05,333 --> 01:55:06,433
The boyd

568
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:09,733
"She's not just a set of legs - there's" … Play the narration

569
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:14,480
She's not just a set of legs. There's a

570
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:16,880
whole devoted mother bird up there. And

571
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:19,760
no one treasures her eggs more than this

572
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:22,239
bird mama. They may someday hatch into

573
01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:25,280
beautiful baby birds. Or maybe just into

574
01:55:22,239 --> 01:55:26,800
beautiful bags of gold or bags of golden

575
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:30,040
babies.

576
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,040
Who knows?

577
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:45,040
Although accustomed to letting her

578
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:46,000
soldiers do all the fighting, this is

579
01:55:45,040 --> 01:55:47,920
one time.

580
01:55:45,933 --> 01:55:48,633
Hold on a second. This text is kind of small

581
01:55:48,899 --> 01:55:55,166
So I'm going to go back and actually enable the game subtitles for the stream

582
01:55:55,533 --> 01:55:57,966
[Didn't] realize it was so small

583
01:56:02,133 --> 01:56:05,033
Let me help you out there with that

584
01:56:09,199 --> 01:56:13,679
Although accustomed to letting her

585
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:16,880
soldiers do all the fighting, this is

586
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:19,119
one tough bug lady. She's an acid

587
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:21,920
spitting queen who will fight to her

588
01:56:19,119 --> 01:56:25,679
last gasp to defend the brood of insect

589
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:27,520
infants incubating inside her egg sack.

590
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:31,480
Oh, if only there was an airlock you

591
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,480
could flush her out of.

592
01:56:29,899 --> 01:56:31,033
[laughs]

593
01:56:35,733 --> 01:56:38,233
Be gone, beast!

594
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:42,366
Dis-gus-tang!, Disgusting beast, get out of here

595
01:56:43,933 --> 01:56:46,633
She is gone, actually, she is dead.

596
01:56:46,633 --> 01:56:49,466
She is gone, actually, she is dead.
We took care of the Queen Ant

597
01:57:06,633 --> 01:57:11,966
I have some questions though. How does the narrator know what an airlock is

598
01:57:12,866 --> 01:57:15,633
Isn't this supposed to be the Medieval times?

599
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:20,733
What else could it be other than a space

600
01:57:21,066 --> 01:57:22,533
A spacecraft

601
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,666
Where am?

602
01:57:54,199 --> 01:58:00,100
Okay probably not the best idea for a sword to be used here

603
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:04,566
Do I get a target if I switch to my bow

604
01:58:09,933 --> 01:58:15,066
I mean it's listed as a boss in the Book of Gallowmere, so I assume we do defeat it

605
01:58:19,466 --> 01:58:22,633
Even though the eggs are what we're coming up here for all right

606
01:58:37,133 --> 01:58:38,666
Oh there we go

607
01:58:40,033 --> 01:58:43,000
Gold for that.

608
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,500
Gold for that. Oh she's gonna be maaad.

609
01:58:55,966 --> 01:58:58,633
Okay I guess no defeating you

610
01:58:58,899 --> 01:59:00,966
Mama bird.

611
01:59:01,766 --> 01:59:03,199
I just leave you,

612
01:59:05,066 --> 01:59:09,199
I'm sure, I'm sure you'll have more babies at some point

613
01:59:12,533 --> 01:59:17,699
Distressed. I'll leave her distressed, and unhappy with me.

614
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:26,266
I thought there would be more to it, but I guess that's it.

615
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,766
I mean I did get money from that, can't argue with that

616
01:59:46,466 --> 01:59:47,366
Shield

617
01:59:47,733 --> 01:59:52,566
This has like Zelda energy, it's like I get a shield but it's useless. what.

618
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:57,033
Literally I already had a shield so

619
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,100
No point in collecting it. I guess I could come back and get it.

620
02:00:02,833 --> 02:00:05,533
Again that's going back to what I said before

621
02:00:05,533 --> 02:00:12,133
it can pay off to know where all the collectibles and the healing spots are in the game

622
02:00:13,333 --> 02:00:18,066
You can go back and prep yourself I guess; they do come back.

623
02:00:19,766 --> 02:00:24,500
Wrong door. It's not the right door.

624
02:00:26,766 --> 02:00:28,366
What am I shooting at

625
02:00:47,833 --> 02:00:50,066
Why's there a gargoyle behind a gate

626
02:00:51,899 --> 02:00:53,266
What is the point of that

627
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:11,899
Shadows

628
02:01:42,866 --> 02:01:45,000
...Why do I want to do this again?

629
02:01:52,933 --> 02:01:55,066
Leave now or share their doom. Okay!

630
02:01:55,633 --> 02:01:57,899
I'll leave. Heheh

631
02:01:59,433 --> 02:02:00,566
I'll leave.

632
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:05,800
I knew I'd drown there, I knew that was a deep pool of water

633
02:02:06,066 --> 02:02:07,533
Not safe not safe.

634
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:11,600
[exhausted sigh]

635
02:02:17,666 --> 02:02:19,366
Yep, I'm leavin'

636
02:02:21,533 --> 02:02:23,633
Gonna go away from that.

637
02:02:32,100 --> 02:02:34,300
Clearly there's something that goes here

638
02:02:35,566 --> 02:02:37,533
To stop these lasers.

639
02:02:51,899 --> 02:02:55,800
You know it wouldn't be the first time I've taken a game too literally

640
02:02:56,766 --> 02:03:01,433
The first time I played Zelda: Breath of the Wild I didn't talk to Impa

641
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:03,600
The entire game, until

642
02:03:03,733 --> 02:03:11,500
I decided, okay I probably missed something I was like oh I am ready I guess I guess you were just...

643
02:03:15,633 --> 02:03:20,600
I took them too seriously and I was like "Okay. I'm probably not ready."

644
02:03:21,066 --> 02:03:23,000
"This might not be a good thing"

645
02:03:25,633 --> 02:03:27,500
That's one way you can play the game,

646
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,533
Just explore it and not focus on the story stuff.

647
02:03:36,466 --> 02:03:41,866
All it was was the memories; you unlock the ability to regain Link's memories.

648
02:03:43,866 --> 02:03:48,899
I think Impa put that a little bit too high up on this seriousness level if you ask me

649
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,500
I'm only going to go somewhere else because I have somewhere else to go

650
02:04:07,233 --> 02:04:13,366
If I need to come, if I need to go back there - fine, I will. But let's just go to the hedge maze here

651
02:04:14,666 --> 02:04:22,000
Asylum Grounds. This is a pretty fun level I think. From what I could, from what I've seen.

652
02:04:22,500 --> 02:04:26,466
At least, it looks cool. I don't know if it's irritating.

653
02:04:57,100 --> 02:04:58,600
Why does that keep happening

654
02:05:02,433 --> 02:05:03,366
Darn gates!

655
02:05:04,166 --> 02:05:06,466
These hinges are too...

656
02:05:06,566 --> 02:05:08,966
These hinges are too... Well,

657
02:05:08,966 --> 02:05:10,000
These hinges are too... Well-maintained.

658
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,100
These hinges are too... Well-maintained. They just
close on their own.

659
02:05:38,433 --> 02:05:39,399
Oh dear

660
02:06:04,866 --> 02:06:05,666
[slight panic]

661
02:06:21,899 --> 02:06:25,033
Case in point - my shield is already gone

662
02:06:28,966 --> 02:06:32,433
Y'know, if it weren't everything in this game being so...

663
02:06:32,833 --> 02:06:34,433
Oh, you want to kill me.

664
02:06:35,433 --> 02:06:38,033
Exactly. It's kind of cute looking isn't it?

665
02:06:40,666 --> 02:06:43,399
It is the cutest thing I've seen in this game.

666
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:47,199
In a strange sort of way

667
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,300
Are you Jack?

668
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:51,899
Are you Jack? Big statue guy

669
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:37,566
Riddles are not my strong suit

670
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:53,920
>> There once was a statue named Jack. For

671
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,560
riddles he did have a knack. Dan entered

672
02:07:53,920 --> 02:08:01,800
the garden which Jack was a-guardin'. A

673
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:01,800
smart hero would have turned back.

674
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:09,599
>> More friendlies is here to listen

675
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:12,239
about.

676
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:15,119
>> Our boneheaded protagonist born again

677
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:13,330
‒ That's not, uh

678
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:17,360
into this age of wonders in life—

679
02:08:15,119 --> 02:08:20,159
Once part of the infamous Cemetery Hill

680
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:22,320
coven, Emelda was ostracized by her

681
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:24,639
sisters when she refused to stop using

682
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:28,400
the communal cauldron to prepare her

683
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:31,119
notoriously pungent lunchtime brews.

684
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:33,440
She now resides in the Enchanted Earth

685
02:08:31,119 --> 02:08:35,119
where no one complains. Or at least if

686
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:38,400
they do, she just turns them into a

687
02:08:35,119 --> 02:08:41,400
toad. And seriously, do NOT lick those

688
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:41,400
toads.

689
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:49,760
A proud and fair race, the Fairies were

690
02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:51,920
rulers of the underground world until

691
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:55,040
that fateful day when the Ant Queen

692
02:08:51,920 --> 02:08:57,360
invaded their turf. Honestly, we don't

693
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:59,760
know why the ants have them imprisoned.

694
02:08:57,360 --> 02:09:02,719
But for some reason, fairy magic doesn't

695
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:07,639
seem to work against ants. Seems odd to

696
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:07,639
me, but hey, I don't make the rules.

697
02:09:14,639 --> 02:09:20,159
>> Rats. They are the rats.

698
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,560
>> These rats seem harmless, but they have

699
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:25,440
tiny fingers, and they're probably

700
02:09:22,560 --> 02:09:27,760
plotting something terrible. Each rat

701
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:32,199
you squish is an act of treason against

702
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:32,199
the mighty rat king Derok.

703
02:09:30,321 --> 02:09:32,153
>> [scheming nasally]

704
02:09:34,079 --> 02:09:39,360
The rat king? Where have I heard that before?

705
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:49,119
>> Zarok's mechanical goon squad, developed

706
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:51,679
deep in the City of Madness (although

707
02:09:49,119 --> 02:09:54,320
manufactured in China, of course). That

708
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:58,960
coal in their stomach fuels them, whilst

709
02:09:54,320 --> 02:10:02,000
also cooking up a mean brisket.

710
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:03,679
Zarok's mechanical goon squad developed

711
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,520
deep in the City of

712
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:08,000
>> Mmm, brisket.

713
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:10,079
>> Disciples of the head monk, these men of

714
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,639
the cloth have been driven mad by the

715
02:10:10,079 --> 02:10:15,679
disappearance of their master - and Jack's

716
02:10:12,639 --> 02:10:18,159
incessant ramblings. The harsh chime of

717
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:20,960
a bell tells them an unwelcome guest has

718
02:10:18,159 --> 02:10:24,520
arrived, or that it's time for dinner.

719
02:10:20,960 --> 02:10:24,520
Perhaps both!

720
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:37,520
Poisonous pollen protects these plants

721
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:40,880
from predators. Just to be safe, they

722
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:44,599
fire it at everything. Can never be too

723
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:44,599
careful these days.

724
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:56,360
>> You actually get Oh, that's the uh the

725
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:56,360
shadow beast.

726
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:02,560
>> Fascinating creatures, ants. Did you

727
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:04,960
know they're as old as the dinosaurs?

728
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:08,079
That they talk using chemicals? Or that

729
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:10,719
they share a hive mind? And contrary to

730
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:15,400
popular belief, they actually have no

731
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:15,400
interest whatsoever in your pants.

732
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:26,000
>> Hear the riddle again.

733
02:11:22,960 --> 02:11:28,560
Ponder it deepler. Deeper.

734
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:35,760
[repeating] At night they come without being

735
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:39,239
fetched; By day they are lost without

736
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:39,239
being stolen.

737
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:19,040
Can't kill the funny looking guy, can I?

738
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:22,119
Yep.

739
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:38,000
The day they are lost without being

740
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:39,920
stolen.

741
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,320
Wait,

742
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:44,639
I also have bad memory. It doesn't help any.

743
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,400
Need a clue, I think, cuz I have

744
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:07,639
nothing. I have no idea what to do with

745
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:07,639
that information.

746
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:25,320
Oh, there's an aforementioned bell.

747
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,899
Seems like part of a puzzle to me

748
02:14:03,766 --> 02:14:05,433
Not the one we're doing now though

749
02:14:34,166 --> 02:14:35,666
Oh. Yeah, ok...

750
02:14:43,399 --> 02:14:44,899
X marks the spot huh

751
02:14:49,766 --> 02:14:53,300
Okay that's definitely a wall I can break down right

752
02:14:54,199 --> 02:14:56,733
Surely that one will be broken

753
02:15:00,733 --> 02:15:01,533
Oh, no

754
02:15:14,766 --> 02:15:15,833
Get back here!

755
02:15:21,433 --> 02:15:23,100
I need you for my Chalice

756
02:15:47,899 --> 02:15:49,600
Stars?

757
02:15:50,233 --> 02:15:52,933
Stars are something that don't show up during the day.

758
02:16:03,533 --> 02:16:05,199
I need to hear that one more time

759
02:16:18,666 --> 02:16:20,966
Stars -would- match that description

760
02:16:24,833 --> 02:16:26,266
But who steals stars?

761
02:16:30,199 --> 02:16:31,433
Why would you say that

762
02:16:46,466 --> 02:16:50,266
Like what else would the topriaries be for right?

763
02:16:51,100 --> 02:16:52,799
Topriary

764
02:16:54,066 --> 02:16:57,000
There we go

765
02:16:57,200 --> 02:17:03,299
Doing the thing with the captioner again.
Bad at pronouncing things.

766
02:17:09,100 --> 02:17:11,833
I'll solve this like I solve any other puzzle!

767
02:17:11,833 --> 02:17:15,533
I'll solve this like I solve any other puzzle!
Wandering around until I figure it out.

768
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:21,299
Stars are it.

769
02:17:22,299 --> 02:17:24,600
Yep. That's it.

770
02:17:25,733 --> 02:17:27,466
He want me to…

771
02:17:28,566 --> 02:17:31,466
Slash up all the star topiaries

772
02:17:36,333 --> 02:17:39,299
Chaos Rune needed

773
02:17:39,299 --> 02:17:41,000
Chaos Rune needed. This gate.

774
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:54,299
Are there two sides to this place

775
02:17:57,333 --> 02:17:58,700
Oh here's one.

776
02:18:24,666 --> 02:18:27,200
Nope. They gotta be over here.

777
02:18:28,466 --> 02:18:30,600
What is that out there, a mansion?

778
02:18:36,366 --> 02:18:38,700
Hm. We'll find out some day.

779
02:18:43,299 --> 02:18:44,233
Is that a squid?

780
02:18:44,933 --> 02:18:45,933
What the heck

781
02:18:51,633 --> 02:18:53,133
What the

782
02:18:53,533 --> 02:18:55,500
Cthulhu is that

783
02:19:18,266 --> 02:19:21,233
I'm beginning to wonder if some of these walls aren't breakable

784
02:19:26,133 --> 02:19:29,799
Shall just try breaking all the walls

785
02:19:30,399 --> 02:19:34,066
Oh there's a face‒ there's faces, in this walls.

786
02:19:34,299 --> 02:19:37,866
These are the hedges of evil.

787
02:19:37,866 --> 02:19:39,233
These are the hedges of evil. Truly.

788
02:19:56,799 --> 02:19:57,933
Fish.

789
02:20:23,266 --> 02:20:26,299
Cross.

790
02:20:26,700 --> 02:20:27,799
X-mark.

791
02:21:56,266 --> 02:21:58,100
Is that a freaking camel

792
02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:02,766
This place is weird man

793
02:22:54,700 --> 02:22:56,033
ope. new way

794
02:23:37,133 --> 02:23:38,200
'k…

795
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,533
Hmm

796
02:25:49,433 --> 02:25:51,399
Need a faster weapon

797
02:25:54,299 --> 02:25:56,133
a *faster* weapon

798
02:26:43,233 --> 02:26:44,333
Almost have it

799
02:27:03,766 --> 02:27:05,233
It doesn't appear to be timed

800
02:27:05,399 --> 02:27:07,500
It's just a matter of being faster

801
02:27:08,066 --> 02:27:11,899
Or, it *does* appear to be timed. There's no, uh

802
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:15,033
Puzzle here

803
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:25,500
Yeah, ah.

804
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:26,500
Yeah, ah. Hmm.

805
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:28,666
Yeah, ah. Hmm. Interesting

806
02:27:43,899 --> 02:27:45,666
Getting so close

807
02:28:17,799 --> 02:28:18,966
Let it reset here

808
02:28:20,533 --> 02:28:27,899
I'm feeling like there's something up here, because I don't have a way to refill my ammo that easily

809
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,266
I can hit them all at the same time, that would be one way of doing it

810
02:30:25,066 --> 02:30:26,166
Hm...

811
02:30:26,166 --> 02:30:28,366
I think the crossbow is the way to go

812
02:31:50,566 --> 02:31:52,500
I can't see anything

813
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:57,166
I can't see Jack

814
02:31:59,566 --> 02:32:01,766
Behind the wall, like that.

815
02:32:01,966 --> 02:32:03,433
But I will go see Jack.

816
02:32:06,666 --> 02:32:09,366
In case I need to do that first

817
02:32:12,766 --> 02:32:13,466
Yes yes.

818
02:32:21,366 --> 02:32:23,333
Get our equipment back up

819
02:32:26,633 --> 02:32:32,833
nah I think we're good with the sword for those guys

820
02:32:32,833 --> 02:32:33,566
nah I think we're good with the sword for those guys, so

821
02:36:00,266 --> 02:36:03,466
I think I'm missing something I need here to complete the level

822
02:36:05,266 --> 02:36:09,533
So we'll just, we'll do this... We'll do this some other time

823
02:36:26,933 --> 02:36:28,633
Time to unleash hell

824
02:36:29,366 --> 02:36:31,299
Yep let's do that

825
02:36:35,566 --> 02:36:37,133
Back to the shadows

826
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:41,366
Uhn-uh uh, that's not the thing you do there

827
02:39:45,733 --> 02:39:49,066
I was thinking I could because there was a,

828
02:39:49,066 --> 02:39:51,566
I was thinking I could because there was, a secret area with

829
02:39:51,933 --> 02:39:54,866
Some money but, I was a little off

830
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:18,299
Wrong door. Again.

831
02:40:35,799 --> 02:40:36,899
There we go

832
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:54,733
Are we at another dead end

833
02:42:57,133 --> 02:42:59,633
These symbols me nothing to me

834
02:43:21,333 --> 02:43:27,299
I don't know if restarting. And quitting, do the same thing for our health or whatever.

835
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:59,266
Ain't no way there's a way to continue right now

836
02:43:59,666 --> 02:44:03,233
I guess we'll go back to the hedge

837
02:44:03,233 --> 02:44:04,666
I guess we'll go back to the hedge, the hedges

838
02:44:13,633 --> 02:44:15,399
Did all that stuff

839
02:44:24,100 --> 02:44:28,299
Oh that's the building we're seeing. The Asylum. That's the Asylum.

840
02:48:46,233 --> 02:48:48,066
That's easy, that's an elephant

841
02:48:54,433 --> 02:48:55,700
Kitties

842
02:52:01,033 --> 02:52:03,666
Yeah, that's right; -eat- my arrows!

843
02:52:07,899 --> 02:52:09,600
Weird bird octopus thing.

844
02:52:12,233 --> 02:52:12,933
Bat.

845
02:52:16,033 --> 02:52:18,366
And it kind of like a

846
02:52:18,700 --> 02:52:20,899
it's like a... it's like a

847
02:52:20,899 --> 02:52:23,133
it's like a... it's like a, cursed

848
02:52:23,466 --> 02:52:25,433
Cthulhu Furby

849
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:26,799
[absurd laughter]

850
02:52:27,600 --> 02:52:29,666
Weird Furby monster

851
02:52:32,833 --> 02:52:36,000
Anything else in this area that I missed

852
02:52:37,100 --> 02:52:41,433
Definitely not. Too small, not much not much to do there

853
02:52:42,033 --> 02:52:44,266
I got the rune, let's head back

854
02:52:49,266 --> 02:52:50,233
Doo

855
02:53:10,799 --> 02:53:14,700
It is going to be a bit of a challenge with all these cats

856
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:16,799
Do I need to kill the cats?

857
02:53:20,233 --> 02:53:22,000
Can I kill the cats?

858
02:53:23,933 --> 02:53:25,299
I just avoid them

859
02:53:27,399 --> 02:53:28,133
Oh dear

860
02:53:30,166 --> 02:53:30,899
[laughs]

861
02:53:45,066 --> 02:53:47,166
Keep this camera angle here

862
02:55:14,533 --> 02:55:18,000
Yes that hides the blood too

863
02:55:19,066 --> 02:55:23,000
What what do they call that game mechanic, in like Call of Duty

864
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:28,166
So many games use that

865
02:55:52,466 --> 02:55:54,200
Nope no new path yet

866
02:56:04,366 --> 02:56:07,633
Ooh I need that. Very badly.

867
02:56:09,600 --> 02:56:11,000
How do I get there

868
02:56:42,266 --> 02:56:43,933
Through the elephant

869
02:56:43,933 --> 02:56:45,399
probably

870
02:56:55,766 --> 02:56:59,533
I am gonna actually stick to ranged attacks here

871
02:57:01,933 --> 02:57:03,133
I'm ready! Come get me.

872
02:57:05,700 --> 02:57:06,766
Cowards

873
02:57:28,066 --> 02:57:29,266
Oh my dear

874
02:57:38,266 --> 02:57:42,566
Does that mean every one of them's defeated or is there still one alive back there

875
02:57:47,666 --> 02:57:50,733
There's still a little bit of error

876
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:52,966
Room for error here.

877
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:11,733
You don't want to touch that chest.

878
02:58:11,733 --> 02:58:15,033
You don't want to touch that chest.
Do not touch that chest.

879
02:58:15,033 --> 02:58:17,399
You don't want to touch that chest.
Do not touch that chest. You will be dead.

880
02:58:19,066 --> 02:58:21,266
Uh, wrong item

881
02:58:32,366 --> 02:58:33,566
[fearful gasp]

882
02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:41,966
I hit the explosive chest.

883
02:58:44,566 --> 02:58:45,933
[sigh of relief]

884
02:58:46,899 --> 02:58:50,033
Came within inches of my life being gone

885
02:58:52,033 --> 02:58:53,866
ohhhh, we survived

886
02:58:53,866 --> 02:58:55,166
ohhh, we survived :)

887
02:58:56,433 --> 02:58:59,500
That is without a doubt the closest I've got

888
02:58:59,633 --> 02:59:03,533
Closest I've got to dying for the longest amount of time. that was…

889
02:59:05,799 --> 02:59:07,633
That was, uhh

890
02:59:13,166 --> 02:59:16,600
Scary. that was scary. Mhm hmm.

891
02:59:17,366 --> 02:59:18,799
Okay…

892
02:59:19,766 --> 02:59:20,666
[mouth click]

893
02:59:32,933 --> 02:59:34,966
What's this then?

894
02:59:35,266 --> 02:59:36,666
All this then?

895
02:59:40,100 --> 02:59:41,200
Clearly a puzzle.

896
02:59:43,433 --> 02:59:47,233
Of which I have no arrows. I need to find a gargoyle.

897
03:00:16,799 --> 03:00:18,366
Or not.

898
03:00:20,233 --> 03:00:22,299
This is very unfair.

899
03:00:26,299 --> 03:00:29,033
Listen, game… If there's one thing you can learn from Zelda,

900
03:00:29,033 --> 03:00:34,100
it's to give me refills in my items that I actually need to complete the dungeon

901
03:00:34,933 --> 03:00:37,433
I have no arrows.

902
03:00:37,666 --> 03:00:40,866
For I was fearing for my life back there.

903
03:00:44,133 --> 03:00:48,066
Maybe I don't use arrows. Maybe maybe there's
something else here.

904
03:00:49,533 --> 03:00:53,833
Okay I could just jump over the fence that's there for, some reason

905
03:00:53,833 --> 03:00:56,966
it's to block the blocks from getting out of the area.

906
03:00:57,933 --> 03:00:58,833
Clearly

907
03:01:08,033 --> 03:01:14,133
I was thinking we'd find a fire arrow puzzle

908
03:01:15,933 --> 03:01:17,700
Maybe at some point. Not here though.

909
03:01:26,133 --> 03:01:29,066
It is a good thing to keep in mind for any enemies

910
03:01:33,233 --> 03:01:36,466
We might want to catch on fire, hehehe

911
03:04:41,933 --> 03:04:45,600
I‒ I guess I was supposed to do that - oh, chess

912
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:47,766
Oi !

913
03:06:22,333 --> 03:06:24,566
Ok,

914
03:06:24,566 --> 03:06:27,366
We have time for one more level.

915
03:07:59,366 --> 03:08:02,333
Okay so now we can enchant a shield as well

916
03:08:02,600 --> 03:08:05,533
Just like I did with my sword, right?

917
03:08:06,933 --> 03:08:10,200
I enchanted it, right? Wrong weapon.

918
03:08:32,133 --> 03:08:35,333
Ok, so it's just a gold shield basically.

919
03:08:35,333 --> 03:08:38,333
Ok, so it's just a gold shield basically.
There's nothing magical about it eh.

920
03:09:07,733 --> 03:09:13,866
I am getting an idea that the Enchanted Earth comes later on in the game, so let's go to the Asylum.

921
03:09:16,100 --> 03:09:17,433
For right now.

922
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:21,700
I feel like we go back to the Enchanted Earth.

923
03:09:23,833 --> 03:09:31,233
Nothing screams "End Of Game" content other than. Shadowy.

924
03:09:31,933 --> 03:09:36,899
Demons beyond our comprehension. Right?

925
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:49,600
Absolute hell on Earth.

926
03:09:56,733 --> 03:09:59,333
Now this is dead-end as dead-ends get

927
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:01,799
This is dead as dead-ends get.

928
03:10:04,633 --> 03:10:06,966
Really nothing to do back there

929
03:11:18,433 --> 03:11:21,733
This is a combat level huh

930
03:11:23,233 --> 03:11:25,266
This is a combat level, isn't it

931
03:11:27,166 --> 03:11:30,333
After we just did a puzzle-only level pretty much

932
03:11:30,799 --> 03:11:33,333
To fight a bunch of stuff

933
03:13:47,966 --> 03:13:49,966
Well, that was fun.

934
03:13:49,966 --> 03:13:51,833
Well, that was fun. Let's go again!

935
03:13:58,933 --> 03:14:01,866
Let's actually, refill our health

936
03:14:02,033 --> 03:14:04,766
we will do much better if we have full health.

937
03:14:07,433 --> 03:14:11,233
Let's just take out all the stops here, in order to succeed

938
03:14:16,600 --> 03:14:19,966
The easiest one at this point would be the Sleeping Village.

939
03:14:19,966 --> 03:14:24,133
The easiest one at this point would be the Sleeping Village.
For a fountain. yeah.

940
03:14:30,033 --> 03:14:33,433
We return to where we started the stream at

941
03:14:34,299 --> 03:14:36,233
Almost 4 hours ago.

942
03:15:15,966 --> 03:15:17,799
I ought to be able to leave here right

943
03:15:51,366 --> 03:15:52,966
Not how it works

944
03:15:53,200 --> 03:15:56,633
And in that case we'll go to an easier level

945
03:16:00,033 --> 03:16:02,200
At least a shorter level

946
03:16:04,700 --> 03:16:06,766
Which one would that be then

947
03:16:16,433 --> 03:16:17,733
Cemetary Hill

948
03:16:20,066 --> 03:16:22,666
Not sure if, the Graveyard might give us the

949
03:16:25,966 --> 03:16:29,966
A refill. Even though I was just there.

950
03:20:25,299 --> 03:20:28,866
Alright time to party

951
03:20:28,866 --> 03:20:30,766
Alright time to party - Thriller style

952
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:39,533
Let's wrap things up

953
03:20:39,700 --> 03:20:43,933
Even though these zombies are not wrapped up in bandages.

954
03:21:07,133 --> 03:21:09,833
Oh I should've enchanted my sword again

955
03:21:17,366 --> 03:21:19,399
Let's yeah let's do that

956
03:21:36,933 --> 03:21:42,866
There is the gargoyle here although we have to finish the level for it to count right

957
03:21:46,633 --> 03:21:49,266
Back we go.

958
03:21:49,266 --> 03:21:51,700
Back we go. That's so silly.

959
03:21:51,700 --> 03:21:54,133
Back we go. That's so silly. I'm so silly.

960
03:21:55,100 --> 03:21:58,766
I don't really think about this game

961
03:22:00,399 --> 03:22:02,133
I am a novice.

962
03:22:06,866 --> 03:22:09,566
I think a lot -of- this game. It's really good.

963
03:25:02,866 --> 03:25:05,266
Bah! Copper shield.

964
03:25:15,066 --> 03:25:19,733
Correct me if I'm wrong you couldn't repeal repair the Silver Shield right

965
03:25:20,100 --> 03:25:21,799
Could you repair your shield before?

966
03:25:22,833 --> 03:25:29,266
'cause those shields weren't given to us from The Hall of Heroes guys. Folk.

967
03:25:30,299 --> 03:25:32,299
Yeah I'm not sure about that

968
03:28:51,600 --> 03:28:54,100
Being a bit of a copycat here

969
03:29:05,166 --> 03:29:06,766
Ooh fast zombies

970
03:29:26,100 --> 03:29:27,700
We're kiting them over

971
03:30:51,799 --> 03:30:55,566
One more to go. Assuming that's correct.

972
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:06,866
Might even be a boss

973
03:31:30,133 --> 03:31:32,366
No room to run here though

974
03:31:43,200 --> 03:31:46,399
And they're not stupid enough to walk into the lava

975
03:31:50,733 --> 03:31:52,433
The coals there, like...

976
03:31:54,033 --> 03:31:54,833
like...

977
03:32:09,466 --> 03:32:13,200
I wouldn't say in unintelligent, they're more

978
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:16,299
Actually crazy.

979
03:32:18,833 --> 03:32:19,799
Yike!

980
03:32:23,233 --> 03:32:25,700
That's a thing that happens

981
03:32:28,966 --> 03:32:31,233
I'll just stay over here and pick them off

982
03:32:46,966 --> 03:32:49,466
Cool but the Chalice isn't full yet.

983
03:32:49,466 --> 03:32:50,700
Cool but the Chalice isn't full yet. Oh yeah it is, okay.

984
03:32:51,399 --> 03:32:52,066
Nice

985
03:32:56,866 --> 03:32:59,033
I fell in the magma once

986
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:00,466
Fortunately

987
03:33:03,500 --> 03:33:05,933
I got to refill again but that doesn't matter anyway

988
03:33:06,033 --> 03:33:10,433
that doesn't matter because I am going to finish the stream now we are going to be complete

989
03:33:11,733 --> 03:33:13,966
With our 4-Hour stream here

990
03:33:13,966 --> 03:33:15,133
With our 4-Hour stream here, that we're gonna

991
03:33:16,100 --> 03:33:18,799
I'm gonna get going here

992
03:33:19,466 --> 03:33:21,066
Who are you.

993
03:33:21,066 --> 03:33:22,766
Who are you. The Mad Hatter?

994
03:33:28,666 --> 03:33:31,366
Actually yeah he probably is just the Mad Hatter innit he?

995
03:34:34,799 --> 03:34:35,833
Thanks mayor

996
03:34:39,133 --> 03:34:41,766
I'm sorry I thought you were a.

997
03:34:43,866 --> 03:34:47,799
Mad Hatter, though. You do look very eccentric.

998
03:34:56,533 --> 03:34:58,433
That everything then?

999
03:34:58,433 --> 03:35:00,366
That everything then? Got the Chalice.

1000
03:35:00,366 --> 03:35:02,799
That everything then? Got the Chalice. A...

1001
03:35:02,799 --> 03:35:05,566
That everything then? Got the Chalice. A Dragon Gem.

1002
03:35:06,200 --> 03:35:07,100
Ooh.

1003
03:35:07,766 --> 03:35:11,833
I think I know what that's for just making a guess here.

1004
03:35:17,633 --> 03:35:18,700
Potentially.

1005
03:35:20,133 --> 03:35:22,666
Might just be for the shadow.

1006
03:35:27,366 --> 03:35:29,399
Shadow monsters

1007
03:35:46,100 --> 03:35:46,899
Yeah sure

1008
03:35:49,133 --> 03:35:53,799
I wasn't wrong about that - the more you have your sword out,

1009
03:35:54,866 --> 03:35:58,200
the more it loses its enchantment

1010
03:36:02,866 --> 03:36:08,399
I left it out while I was away and it just wasn't enchanted when I came back

1011
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:12,866
Repair the Gold Sh‒ Yeah that's, good.

1012
03:37:37,933 --> 03:37:39,033
Alrighty

1013
03:37:40,133 --> 03:37:44,799
Yeah I think we need to go back to the enchanted forest I think that's what the Dragon Gem's for.

1014
03:37:46,533 --> 03:37:51,366
But I'm not going to do any, anymore of that level
I just want to see if it does anything.

1015
03:38:08,200 --> 03:38:16,399
Seems like we need four of something in order to do the shadow, tomb, demon place.

1016
03:38:33,899 --> 03:38:35,033
This was fun

1017
03:38:35,933 --> 03:38:38,533
I made a lot more progress

1018
03:38:40,399 --> 03:38:43,633
Than I thought I would in 4 hours... But, pretty good

1019
03:38:44,299 --> 03:38:45,566
Pre‒tty good.

1020
03:39:13,399 --> 03:39:17,899
Actually we have two paths in the forest, still, here

1021
03:39:24,533 --> 03:39:27,100
There appears to be two different ways we can go

1022
03:39:30,600 --> 03:39:32,500
Curious. Is...?

1023
03:39:36,633 --> 03:39:40,633
It would totally say if...

1024
03:39:40,633 --> 03:39:42,433
It would totally say if, I could use this here

1025
03:39:42,600 --> 03:39:44,266
It is not saying anything.

1026
03:39:58,933 --> 03:40:00,100
I'm not going to

1027
03:40:00,100 --> 03:40:03,799
I'm not going to, no healing.
I can't finish this level, right

1028
03:42:49,433 --> 03:42:53,399
Right. It is also a puzzle. It's a matter of order.

1029
03:42:57,633 --> 03:43:00,633
OK. I get it.

1030
03:43:06,066 --> 03:43:07,733
Cool.

1031
03:43:07,733 --> 03:43:10,666
Cool. I think. I think this is cool?

1032
03:43:15,566 --> 03:43:17,366
That doesn't seem like it

1033
03:43:29,500 --> 03:43:34,333
And now we must catch all the ghosts‒ I mean, destroy the Shadows right?

1034
03:43:34,933 --> 03:43:39,466
We didn't unleash any Luigi's Mansion-esque monsters upon us

1035
03:43:39,633 --> 03:43:41,700
This is much more serious than that

1036
03:43:41,899 --> 03:43:44,666
But I'm going to I'm going to call the stream

1037
03:43:46,333 --> 03:43:47,633
Call it here

1038
03:43:50,833 --> 03:43:52,100
Go ahead and

1039
03:43:57,166 --> 03:44:02,299
Gonna go ahead and click end because I don't really have any music tonight, and

1040
03:44:09,700 --> 03:44:13,200
I'd like to do a few things before I go to bed so

1041
03:44:13,366 --> 03:44:17,133
Get right to that. Thanks for watching.
